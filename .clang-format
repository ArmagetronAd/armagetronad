# to apply these settings on git commit on changed lines only, the easiest way
# is to use pre-commit; read .pre-commit-config.yaml for details.
# 
# Another way is this pre-commit hook:
#   https://github.com/barisione/clang-format-hooks
# clone it somewhere, run '/path/to/clone/git-pre-commit-format install'

# test diff with
# git checkout src; find . -iname '*.h' -o -iname '*.cpp' | parallel clang-format -i; git diff src | wc -l
# diff count: 118038

# closest to our legacy style...

# letting clang-format handle that does not work well enough and one needs

# we have more "int* x" than "int *x" (or "int * x")
