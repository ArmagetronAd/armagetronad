Directories
===========

The various directories you can set have the following impact on how the game
loads and saves files. (Usually, you don't have to bother about it; there are
reasonable defaults. But if you want to do some meddling with the data, these
options are your ticket.)

Data
====

Sounds, textures and models will be first looked for in the directory
specified with ``--userdatadir``. If they are not found there or if
``--userdatadir`` was not used, they are looked for in the directory specified
with ``--datadir``. This directory defaults to the current directory if not
specified.

Configuration
=============

Configuration files are first looked for in ``--userconfigdir``, then
``--userdatadir/config`` (the dir passed to ``--userdatadir``, appended with
/config), then ``--configdir`` and finally ``--datadir/config``.

Logs and user configuration
===========================

Log files (game results, the settings made in the in game menu) are loaded
from ``--vardir``, then, if not found there, from ``--userdatadir/var`` and
finally from ``--datadir/var``. They are only saved in the first of these
directories that was specified.
