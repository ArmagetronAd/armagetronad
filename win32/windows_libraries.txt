Here are some short directions on compiling Armagetron on windows.
You will need Code::Blocks. The sources are distributed over three
SVN modules: the generic sources are in "armagetronad", the Code::Blocks
build files are in "armagetronad/win32" (which you probably
already have, since this file usually lives there) and the libraries
Armagetron depends on are in "winlibs". You need to check out the two
modules from the repository at

https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/armagetronad

1.  Create a project directory (e.g. C:\Projects\Armagetron)
2.  put the armagetronad source files there
3.  In the same directory, put the winlibs files
4.  It should look something like this:
    +- Armagetron
       +- armagetronad
       +- winlibs
5.  Check you've got python installed and set the path to the executable
    inside python.bat
6.  Go to the armagetronad/win32 directory
    run update_version.bat
7.  Start the Armagetron workspace (Armagetron.workspace)
8.  To compile you will need to change the project's target to either 
    Release, Debug or Profile (it defaults to Release)
9.  Go to the armagetronad/win32 directory
    Run the makedist.bat file to copy all neccessary files into
    +- Armagetron
       +- armagetronad
          +- build
             +- dist
             +- debug
             +- profile
    the build directories (dist, debug or profile).

Note: Only directories that are already present will be updated.
      At the end you will get a status report about missing files.
