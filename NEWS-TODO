This is the list of to-do things planned ahead. More will be added as ideas stream in.

= SET_ZONE_ID_* command to use when using zone_id instead of zone_name.
= Add HIDE_CYCLES to menu under "Special Setup" since many don't know the proper use of console commands.
= Create /chat for the use of moderators, admins and higher access level (level < 2) players.
