# each line is an animation frame.
# the format is <frame duration> <list of texture files>.
# the textures are displayed with the first in the background and the last in the foreground.
# during the frame duration, the alpha test threshold for the last texture is continuously lowered
# from 1 to 0. This makes translucent elements of the texture pop in and allows limited
# in-frame smooth animation.
# empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
