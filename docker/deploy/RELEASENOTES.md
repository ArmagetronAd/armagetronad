This is from the 0.2.8.3 branch of development. 
It is the most recent LTS (Long Term Support) branch.
While it is the most recent LTS branch, 
it will receive security fixes, adaptions to new
compilers and Linux versions and some less important bugfixes.

Target audience for this series are mostly Linux distributors who do not want 
to upgrade to 0.2.9 just yet.
If you are in that camp and need help integrating the changes into your build, 
contact us.

We started to integrate builds for [macOS](https://wiki.armagetronad.org/index.php?title=MacOS).
Consider them alpha for now, testing and patches very welcome. The current macOS specific issues
can be viewed [on our tracker](https://gitlab.com/armagetronad/armagetronad/-/issues?label_name%5B%5D=macOS).
