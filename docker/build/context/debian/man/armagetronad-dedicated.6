.TH ARMAGETRONAD-DEDICATED 6 "February 08, 2007"
.SH NAME
armagetronad-dedicated \- an Armagetron Advanced dedicated game server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/init.d/armagetronad-dedicated \{start|stop|restart|force-reload|status\}
.PP
\fBarmagetronad-dedicated\fP [\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP] [\fB\-v, \-\-version\fP] [\fB\-\-doc\fP] [\fB\-\-fastforward\fP] [\fB\-\-benchmark\fP] [\fB\-\-record\fP] [\fB\-\-playback\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The Armagetron Advanced dedicated server runs from an initscript --
to enable running it on boot, edit \fB/etc/default/armagetronad-dedicated\fP.
.PP
The server program will read default settings from
\fB/etc/armagetronad/settings_dedicated.cfg\fP. Modifications and custom
server settings should be implemented in the file
\fB/etc/armagetronad/settings_custom.cfg\fP.
.PP
To edit configuration on-the-fly or make time-sensitive temporary
changes, it's best to log onto the server from the armagetronad
client and log on as an administrator (using the password set in
the server configuration). Console input is not available when
running the server as a daemon.
.PP
Before each round is started, the file \fB/etc/armagetronad/everytime.cfg\fP
is read; it may be useful to use this for things like randomly
changing maps or other quickly changing settings.
