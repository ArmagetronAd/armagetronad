.TH ARMAGETRONAD 6 "February 07, 2007"
.SH NAME
armagetronad \- a 3D Tron-like high speed game
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBarmagetronad\fP [\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP] [\fB\-v, \-\-version\fP] [\fB\-\-doc\fP] [\fB\-f, \-\-fullscreen\fP] [\fB\-w, \-\-window, \-\-windowed\fP] [\fB\-\-fastforward\fP] [\fB\-\-benchmark\fP] [\fB\-\-record\fP] [\fB\-\-playback\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The rules are simple: you ride a lightcycle (a kind of motorbike that
can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be
stopped). Avoid running into a wall. Make your opponent run into a
wall.  This idea comes from the 1982 Disney movie "Tron".
.PP
One thing is different than in other Tron clones: you can accelerate.
However, there is a catch. The only way to accelerate is to drive close
to player walls. This allows for some interesting tactics. Every time you
make a turn, you lose 5% of your speed -- so don't be too nervous, speed
is your only resource against other players!
.PP
First thing you shold do is go into the "Player Menu" to set your name and
your keyboard and mouse configuration. Then, go into the "Game Menu" and
start a single player game against one AI opponent (the game mode does
not really matter here). Then, get some friends together and try the
multiplayer modes!
.PP
\fBSHIFT-ESC\fP is the "boss key" and quits Armagetron as fast as
possible.
