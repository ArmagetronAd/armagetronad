Description: Common files for the Armagetron Advanced packages
 Armagetron Advanced is a 3D game based on the light cycle racing in the 80s-
 era movie "Tron".

 You have to control a light cycle that can only turn in steps of 90 degrees,
 leaves a solid wall behind and can not be stopped.  The aim is to survive the
 longest of all players by not crashing into any walls.
 .
 This package contains the common configuration files and documentation shared
 between the armagetronad and armagetronad-dedicated packages.

Description: 3D Tron-like high speed game
 The rules are simple: you ride a light cycle (a kind of motorbike that can
 only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be stopped)
 and have to avoid running into walls while at the same time you have to try to
 get your opponent to run into them.
 .
 The idea is based on the Disney movie from 1982 called "Tron".  If you ever
 wanted to take a try at one of those speed demons features in the movie, this
 is your chance.
 .
 Armagetron Advanced can be played against AI opponents, against other humans
 over the network, or a mixture of both.

Description: dedicated game server for Armagetron Advanced
 Armagetron Advanced is a 3D game based on the light cycle racing in the movie
 "Tron". You have to control a light cycle that can only turn in steps of 90
 degrees, leaves a solid wall behind and can not be stopped.  The aim is to
 survive the longest of all players by not crashing into any walls.
 .
 This version of Armagetron Advanced can only be used as a network game server.
 It does not have graphical output and can be controlled via the text console.
 .
 The normal Armagetron Advanced used for playing is also capable to serve
 games, but will require X to display its graphics, will provide a player and
 is therefore unsuited for permanent game servers.
