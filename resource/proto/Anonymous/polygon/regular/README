Directory for arenas of regular, polygonial type.

Definition: polgyonial maps are described in the README one
level up. A regular polygon is a polygon with the highest
possible symmetry: all sides have equal length and all inner
angles have equal size.

See here for a mathematical definition:

This is a very restrictive criterion; That's why it's a
special category in the Anonymous folder. There is not much
creativity involved in doing a regular, polygonial map. 
You can only choose the number of sides and the 
orientation (the size is more or less fixed by our requirement
that maps should be about 500x500 units). 
You get to pick the spawnpoints, though.

Use <Map author="Anonymous" category="polygon/regular" ...> 
to categorize your map here.
