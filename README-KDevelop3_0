Ok so you want to use KDevelop 3.0 to compile the source. This should be possible if you follow steps below. It works for the creator, thats me, subby.

get the source

"cvs co armagetron"  

(I assume you will have already done this as this is the only way you could get the file you are reading for now :)

run 'autoconf' if this fails run 'aclocal' then try 'autoconf'

do 'chmod +x configure'

run 'kdevelop' if you haven't done so already

go to Project|Open Project

select 'armagetron.kdevelop' and press OK

go to Build|Run Configure

If all goes smoothly, you can now edit armagetron advanced and run it.
