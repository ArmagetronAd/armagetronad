Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r812
- Fixed the coloring problem with the * icon when players are either in chat mode or idle
- Added new ladderlog command:
  * LADDERLOG_WRITE_CYCLE_DESTROYED   Output: CYCLE_DESTROYED [auth_name] [posX] [posY] [dirX] [dirY] [team]
  * LADDERLog_WRITE_PLAYER_ENTERED_GRID         Writes when a player entered server to play on the grid
  * LADDERLOG_WRITE_PLAYER_ENTERED_SPECTATOR    Writes when a player entered server as a spectator
    Both PLAYER_ENTERED_[GRID/SPECTRTOR] were derived from PLAYER_ENTERED ladderlog command so that we can
    be more specific as to which way the player entered the server.
  * LADDERLOG_WRITE_PLAYER_AI_ENTERED           Writes when a ai entered the grid
  * LADDERLOG_WRITE_PLAYER_AI_LEFT              Writes when a ai left the grid       

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r811
- Added new commands:
  * MAP_QUEING        Store and load maps in a que every round until empty. The maps must exist in MAP_ROTATION
  * CONFIG_QUEING     Store and load configs in a que every round until empty. The configs must exist in CONFIG_ROTATION
     # While the que is not empty, the normal rotation will pause.
     # Once empty, the rotation will resume from last pause point.
     # If the rotation is set to rotate per round and this ended half-way through the round, then you'll be stuck
       in the same map before the rotation changes the map unless you choose to manually MAP_FILE author/category/...
     # You can only add one map/config to the queing system each time you use it
  * CONFIG_ROTATION_TYPE        What type of loading will the CONFIG_ROTATION files use? 0-INCLUDE or 1-RINCLUDE? Default: 0
  * RESET_MAP_QUEING            Clears all entries in the list of maps
  * RESET_CONFIG_QUEING         Clears all entries in the list of configs
  * ACCESS_LEVEL_QUE_MAPS       The level required for any player to use /mq add & remove    
  * ACCESS_LEVEL_QUE_CONFIGS    The level required for any player to use /cq add & remove
  * SHOT_BASE_RESPAWN           If enabled, when you shoot at your team base, your teammates will be revived
  * SHOT_BASE_ENEMY_RESPAWN     If enabled, when you shoot at your enemy team's base, your enemies will be revived          
- Chat commands:
  * /mq - Map Queing; /cq - Config Queing;
    Their arguments are as follows:
    1. list/ls       - Lists the items that are in the que currently.
    2. add [item]    - Adds a new item specified by [item]. It does not make a new copy of the existing item in the que.
    3. remove [item] - Removes a item that already exists in the que as specified by [item].
  * !race stats [player_name]
    The new argument's explanations:
    1. [player_name] - This is where you enter a player's name to search for in the racing records.  
- Fixed Commited:
  * Fixed the variables with the ball and base zone commands   
    + Base zone commands:
      - FORTRESS_SURVIVE_WIN - Changed fron int to bool. Easier to handle.
      - FORTRESS_CONQUER_WIN - Changed from int to bool.
    + Ball zone commands:
      - BALL_KILL       - Changed from int to bool.
      - BALL_TEAM_MODE  - Changed from int to bool. Easier to handle.
  * Fixed the saving racing map records. Now they will save in var directory as:
    .../var/race_scores/author/category/...
    This seems to be a lot better handler than the earlier code as two maps with similar names from different
    authors did cause a glitch in the records.                

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r808
- Racing script has been coded again for as better and flexible recording of score and time
- Racing now displays best time or best score depending on RACE_SORT_TYPE
- Added new command:
  CYCLE_RUBBER_DEPLETE_SELF   Enabled, it will reduce rubber like normal when you hit your own tail
  CYCLE_RUBBER_DEPLETE_ENEMY  Enabled, it will reduce rubber like normal when you hit enemy's tail
  CYCLE_RUBBER_DEPLETE_TEAM   Enabled, it will reduce rubber like normal when you hit team's tail
  CYCLE_RUBBER_DEPLETE_RIM    Enabled, it will reduce rubber like normal when you hit the rim wall
  All of the above commands are proved to work but after a certain acceleration, they loose affect and
  people will be killed instantly.
- New Chat command for racing: !race
  If you use !race stats, then it wil display your rank, score and best time for that map
- Taking the example of the chat symbol from the TRUNK version, the * before the player's name
  when they are chatting has been added. 

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r806
- Placed ROUND_ENDED and MATCH_ENDED in a better location
- PLAYER_MESSAGE doesn't require the " " to enclose the message
- The race scores, times will be written as the player reaches the winzone or dies.

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r800
- Recording racing scores and best time, now it also records your player names
  OUTPUT: [ranked_name] [high_scores] [best_time] [player_name]
- In previous versions, players enter the race ladder only when they enter the winzone.
  Now they can enter the ladder even without reaching the winzone. Though, please try
  and reach it :P

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r797
- Added RACE_TRYOUTS
  This enables players to play for this many amounts during a round if they die.
  It depletes everytime they die.
    
Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r796
- Added RACE_HIGHSCORES_LOCATION command
  This command is to tell the game where the scores will be located and read from.
  Default value is NULL. When it's NULL (need to be capital), the game automatically refers back to the /var/ directory.
  
Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r795
- Fixed the problems occuring with RACE_SCORE_TYPE.
  I accidently put them in reverse order:
    When it's meant to sort by score, it sorts by time and vice-versa.     

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r793
- Added ladderlog.txt command: SHUTDOWN
  This command is outputed once the server has been shutdown using the EXIT/QUIT
  commands.
- Added RACE_SCORE_TYME [0|1|2]
  This command allows for your racing scores to be sorted in whatever way:
  0 - No sorting
  1 - Sort by best score
  2 - Sort by best time
- Racing highscores and best times will be logged in /var/race_scores/map_name-version.aamap.xml.txt
  I found it a lot easier to deal with using the maps full name and then dealing with it from there.
  You can use your scripts to input in the ladderlog command CURRENT_MAP and use that to do whatever
  that you need it to do.

Changes in 0.2.9_sty+ct+ap_r792
- Added ladderlog.txt commands:
  ROUND_ENDED
  MATCH_ENDED
- Foster McLane adjusted the outside bounds of the arena so as to make sure fools
  don't try to force themselves outside the arena walls any furthur than 1 meter
  of the perimeter.
