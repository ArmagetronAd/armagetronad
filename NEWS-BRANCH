Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r796
- Added RACE_HIGHSCORES_LOCATION command
  This command is to tell the game where the scores will be located and read from.
  Default value is NULL. When it's NULL (need to be capital), the game automatically refers back to the /var/ directory.
  
Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r795
- Fixed the problems occuring with RACE_SCORE_TYPE.
  I accidently put them in reverse order:
    When it's meant to sort by score, it sorts by time and vice-versa.     

Changes in 0.2.9-sty+ct+ap_r793
- Added ladderlog.txt command: SHUTDOWN
  This command is outputed once the server has been shutdown using the EXIT/QUIT
  commands.
- Added RACE_SCORE_TYME [0|1|2]
  This command allows for your racing scores to be sorted in whatever way:
  0 - No sorting
  1 - Sort by best score
  2 - Sort by best time
- Racing highscores and best times will be logged in /var/race_scores/map_name-version.aamap.xml.txt
  I found it a lot easier to deal with using the maps full name and then dealing with it from there.
  You can use your scripts to input in the ladderlog command CURRENT_MAP and use that to do whatever
  that you need it to do.

Changes in 0.2.9_sty+ct+ap_r792
- Added ladderlog.txt commands:
  ROUND_ENDED
  MATCH_ENDED
- Foster McLane adjusted the outside bounds of the arena so as to make sure fools
  don't try to force themselves outside the arena walls any furthur than 1 meter
  of the perimeter.
