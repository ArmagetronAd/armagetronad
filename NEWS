Changes since 0.2.8.1:
- Timestamps and teamscores added to scorelog.txt
- Dedicated server now works on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
- User running the dedicated server is called "armagetronad" again, the
  longer "armagetronad-dedicated" caused problems with BSD

- Ping variance influence on packet loss tolerance code is now clamped
  by the regular, configurable, packet loss tolerance: effect of variance
  can be no bigger than the effect of ping.
- Spectators are now regular players and can chat
- The /msg command now converts the entered pattern into the internal
  name so if you write "/msg �" and there is a user named "�" with
  an internal nick of "oau" it will still get matched
- Team changes are now only executed when allowed, the need for the
  temporary/permanent team imbalance setting distinction has gone away
- Added brake toggle button
  Bugfixes:

- ALLOW_CONTROL_DURING_CHAT now ignores modifier keys like shift and
  has been reactivated
- The camera sometimes got stuck in free mode for the first round you watch

- After a "perfect" 180, you're more often on the right side of your own wall
  That code caused some havoc at first, so it has been reworked

  and too quick keypresses were causing trouble.

  to write files anywhere, provided they did not exist previously.
  Clients with this vulnerability are locked out of the server now.

- Extremely low values of CYCLE_DELAY were not honored, an arbitrary delay of .005s
  was added to it.
- On entering a server, the camera would sometimes be stuck in free mode.

Changes since 0.2.8.0_rc2:
- Almost final artwork
- Moviepacks can now also contain texture replacements for the default cycle model
- Added number of teammates alive to HUD
  Bugfixes:
- Dual textured floor rendering is now disabled without alpha blending as it
  did not work anyway.
- Lag-O-Meter now has the correct size (the old, buggy one can be restored by
  setting LAG_O_METER_SCALE to .5).

  circumstances just crashed.

Changes since 0.2.8.0_rc1:
- Bugfixes:
  Dedicated server for Windows works again.
  Cycle turns are now executed more accurately on the server.
  Timer stuttering at end of round (was non-critical, but ugly).
  Custom camera did not turn when the internal camera was
  configured not to turn.
  Idle player kick code crashed when it kicked a client with
  many players.
  The code that removes inactive players after a while removed
  the AI players.
- Reverted smart camera movement to pre-beta4 behavior,
  the new code made some players seasick :)
- Ingame admin interface gives more useful information to the invoker
- Small font rendering improvements
- Zone conquest message, if it is not the one that ends the round,
  now states the name of the zone owning team.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta4.2:
- Fixed bugs:
  Random client disconnection
  Another vote-not-appearing-on-client bug
  Invisible wall segments right after turn
  Arena initialization before all settings are transmitted from the server
  The server was using more rubber than the client sometimes

  (CHATTER/IDLE_REMOVE_TIME,IDLE_KICK_TIME)
- Players/team leaders can pause the game before a rond starts (PLAYER_CHAT_WAIT*)
- Color codes can be filtered from player names (FILTER_COLOR_NAMES)

Changes since 0.2.8_beta4:
- Fixed bugs:
  Windows version had a memory overwrite error causing crashes and weird behavior.
  The game quit when the chat key and a key bound to an instant chat were pressed to quickly.
  Votes expired too early on the client.
  Performance: a lot of unused temporary walls were hanging around each round.
  Cycles sometimes warped to odd locations.
- Tweaked smart camera to not stay in front of the cycle so much.
  Tweaked smart camera custom glancing.
  Report back whether you like or hate it!
- Made custom camera even more configurable, changed default settings.
  (old ones are still in settings.cfg)
- Forced glancing end on cycle turn now looks better.
- FOV settings now deal better with wide screens/splitscreen mode.
- Increased ping measurements again by adding the fluctuations. The raw
  average ping caused the game logic to be too picky.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta3:
- Famous fixed bugs:
  Random huge felt lag or blank screen (it was actually a problem with the timer) is gone.
  Bogus "possible phase bug" message.
  Seemingly random walls popping out of nothing, only to disappear a second later.
  Random camera focus changes while you were still alive.
  Every 100th console line got deleted.
- Reduced pings! Actually, just the measurement is improved, the actual latency
  stays the same. I hope nobody notices that. Good thing nobody reads NEWS files :)
- New text editing convenience: Home and end keys work, and CTRL+left/right/del/backspace
  work on whole words. Thanks, Nemo!
- New instant chat functions: There are now 25 instant chat strings. If an instant
  chat string ends in a \, it will not be sent immediately, it's opened to be edited by you.
  Pressing an instant chat key while already chatting will insert the string, provided the
  key does not produce a regular character.
- If enabled by the server administrator: control your cycle while you chat.
- Turning speed of custom and internal camera can be adjusted with CAMERA_CUSTOM_TURN_SPEED
  and CAMERA_IN_TURN_SPEED.
- The custom camera zooms out from a closeup at round start. Useful to see your position
  in your team. Configurable with CAMERA_CUSTOM_ZOOM.
- Master server redundancy enabled. Thanks to Lucifer for hosting the backup master!

Changes since 0.2.8_beta2:
- More bugfixes: most annoying was the crash/infinite loop a server got in when
  the master server was unreachable
- Added zones to map specification
- Reworked top level map format (sorry to the map makers for the inconvenience)
- Windows: added start menu entries that open the system and user data directories
- Bandwidth limitation now works. That means if you lowered the bandwidth
  limits in the network setup, they were not respected. You probably should
  readjust them.

- bugfixes, of course
- added recording and playback startmenu entries for Windows
- abuse prevention: added IP banning, player number per IP and client limit,
  doublebinding can be crippled on server command

Changes since 0.2.7.1:
- Server side cycle synchronization issues fixed:
  destination removal fixed
  lag sliding caused by different interpretation of grinding turn commands on client and server fixed
  niceness for older clients: sync interval decreased, no sync in front of wall to prevent local tunneling
