Changes since 0.2.8.3_rc1:
- Fixed dark color filters, such as FILTER_DARK_COLOR_STRINGS, to not filter
  the reset color.
- ASE moviepack models no longer have a vertex count limit
- Fixed endless recursion crash between rounds

Changes since 0.2.8.3_beta3:
- Chat prefix spam protection. Guards against prefix spam, such as when a
  user always changes their chat message color, or prefixes all messages
  with a clan tag. Toggle with the PREFIX_SPAM_ENABLE setting.

  reference time.
- Fixed single player highscore list not containing everyone.
- Fixed generation of duplicate names in highscore lists.
- Fixed camera crash when the grid is empty.

Changes since 0.2.8.3_beta2:
- Fixed 'invincibility' bug. It really was cycles freezing in time.
- Fixed sporadic sound related crash at round end.
- setting rename: SILENCE_ALL -> SILENCE_DEFAULT.
- Sound no longer gets muted after you switch the sound settings.
- Fixed object collision detection that would sometimes pick a wrong 
  wall to collide with, most likely the reason behind wrongly accredited
  kills.
- Fixed inability to switch viewport assignment in four player mode.
- Better handling of lag clusterbombs.
- Server disconnects now also take immediate effect even when you're
  in a menu or chatting.

Changes since 0.2.8.3_beta1:
- Made ready for Armatrators
- Authentication routines now use utf8 as forward- compatibility with
  trunk. Previously, non-ASCII usernames simply didn't work at all.
- Better lag slide protection: clients no longer get confused when
  the server sends their cycle back in time, and the server no longer
  does that for old clients.
- Fixed rare wallpassing bug; it required what whould usually be an
  instakill and infinte wall length.

Changes since 0.2.8.2:

  New settings and commands:
- MIN_PLAY_TIME_*: minimal play time required before you are allowed to
  play on this server.
- SPAM_AUTOKICK_COUNT: minimal number of spam warning messages you get in a
  row before you get kicked.

- new vote type "/vote suspend <player>" suspends a player for 
  VOTING_SUSPEND_ROUNDS rounds.
- new vote type "/vote include <file>", includes configuration file
  vote/<file>.
- new vote type "/vote command <command>" executes console command
  <command>. (Both that and /vote include are by default only available
  to moderators).
- VOTING_HARM_TIME: time between all harmful votes against a player
- VOTING_KICK_MINHARM: auto-transform the first few menu issued kick 
  votes to suspensions
- (UN)SUSPEND kicks a player to spectator mode with a timeout. Intended to
  let new players watch before they play.
- VOTES_CANCEL cancels all running polls.
- VOTING_SUSPEND [<minutes>] disallows voting during a specified amount of time.

- SCORE_HOLE for awarding sacrifice.
- SCORE_SURVIVE for player survival and FORTRESS_HELD_SCORE for not losing
  each fortress zone.
- KICK_TO and MOVE_TO: redirect a client to a different server
- DEFAULT_KICK(_TO)_MESSAGE: default reason given to players for a kick
- DEFAULT_KICK_TO_SERVER/PORT: default redirection target for KICK/MOVE_TO.

- If all clients support it, PING_CHARITY_MIN/MAX can be used to constrain ping charity.
- VOTE_KICK_TO_SERVER/PORT: redirection target for vote kicks.
- SILENCE and VOICE allow to control chat of annoying players.
- SILENCE_ALL can be used on the server to inhibit all cross-team communication unless specifically voiced.

- FORTRESS_CONQEST_TIMEOUT: if an enemy contact with a zone happens longer ago than
  this value, it is discarded from zone memory.
- TOPOLOGY_POLICE_PARALLEL, extra topology police flag to control the checks
  for walls getting copied into the grid in exactly the same place.
- CAMERA_GLANCE_*: separate settings for the glancing camera, work like CAMERA_CUSTOM_*.
  Likewise, CAMERA_SERVER_GLANCE_* can replace CAMERA_SERVER_CUSTOM_* when glancing.
  CAMERA_*CUSTOM_GLANCE* are server side settings that can control whether server or
  clientside settings are used in various situations, see settings.cfg for details.
- CYCLE_BOOST_? and CYCLE_BOOSTFACTOR_? for boosts when breaking away from walls,
  see settings.cfg or config.html for details
- CYCLE_ACCEL_TUNNEL, works like CYCLE_ACCEL_SLINGSHOT, but is active when
  none of the two walls you're in between is your own.
- CYCLE_WIDTH for making it impossible to squeeze through tight tunnels,
  see settings.cfg for details
- VOTING_MATURITY controls how long you have to wait after login before
  you can issue kick votes.
- CYCLE_DELAY_DOUBLEBIND_BONUS is an extra factor applied to CYCLE_DELAY
  for turns in the same direction. Can be used to limit the advantage
  doublebinders get while not punishing players who press both left and
  right at the same time.
- LAG_O_METER_(TRESHOLD|BLEND|USE_OLD): Configure the minimal size of the
  Lag-O-Meter, its color and whether to scrap it all and stick with the old
  one.

  a new team or change to another team.
- ALLOW_TEAM_CHANGE_PLAYER/DISALLOW_TEAM_CHANGE_PLAYER: allow/disallow specific
  players to switch teams
- INTERCEPT_COMMANDS is a space-delimited list of chat commands that shall be
  intercepted by an external script. Example value: /login /admin /teamleave
  /teamshuffle /shuffle /team
- INTERCEPT_UNKNOWN_COMMANDS is a boolean specifying if an external script
  wishes to handle unrecognized chat commands. This would allow hooking
  arbitrary things like /foobarz or /mode ctf
- CONSOLE_LADDER_LOG boolean places the ladderlog on stdout prefixed with
  "[L] "
- PLAYER_MESSAGE <user ID or name> <Message>: Like /msg, but from the
  console
- All ladderlog outputs can be enabled or disabled separately by using
  LADDERLOG_WRITE_*. LADDERLOG_WRITE_ALL enables or disables all ladderlog
  output alltogether.
- CHAT_LOG controls whether to write a machine-readable chatlog to
  var/chatlog.txt
- CONSOLE_DECORATE_TIMESTAMP write a timestamp for every console message?
- LADDERLOG_DECORATE_TIMESTAMP prefix every ladderlog message with a timestamp?
- SLAP <player> [points] sends a message to everyone and subtracts a number
  of points (default: 1) from <player>'s score. Negative points are
  supported.
- AUTO_TEAM_SPEC_SPAM to disable the spectator join/leave messages you get
  when AUTO_TEAM is enabled

If --enable-armathentication was activated:
- /lock, /unlock, /invite and /uninvite team management chat for players of
  access level ACCESS_LEVEL_TEAM or better.
- /teams chat command that rougly prints team layout.
- ACCESS_LEVEL_IPS to let admins see IPs of players in the list.
- ACCESS_LEVEL_SPY_MSG/TEAM to let admins spy on team/private messages.

- GLOBAL_ID_ENABLED to toggle remote accounts
- LOCAL_USER, LOCAL_TEAM for local login accounts
- MD5_PREFIX/MD5_SUFFIX for additional password scrambling
- USER_LEVEL to grant users various access levels
- RESERVE_SCREEN_NAME to reserve a screen name to a certain player
- USER_ALIAS to bend authentication names around 
- (UN)BAN_USER to ban really stupid users based on their global user ID, 
  BAN_USER_LIST to show a list.
- ACCESS_LEVEL_OP/ADMIN/CHAT/PLAY/PLAY_SLIDING to control who can do which things
- /login chat command then uses the more secure hashed base logins
- new chat commands /op and /deop to change other players' access rights

  Featurelets:
- Added Polish language file
- clientside play time tracking and server controlled minimal required experience
  to be allowed to play.
- color codes in chat increase the spam level logarithmically.
- /team messages get a reduced spam level; reduction factor is given by 
  (team size)/(number of total players).
- /team messages can be used by spectators to chat with other spectators only.
- Performance optimizations. Using OpenGL display lists to cache geometry.
- Removed ztrick, antialiasing and perspective correction settings. They all had only one right
  setting and caused us some interesting bug reports.
- Added PLAYER_RANDOM_COLOR for lazy people who just want to have a
  color that differs from everyone else on the server.
- Configuration files get reloaded on SIGHUP
- all admin commands now also accept partial name matches, like /msg, and check for case sensitive
  matches in the screen name first, then the user name, then case insensitive matches in the two.
- --enable-krawallserver has been actually implemented now, and it enables secure logins
  to accounts local to the server and not-so-secure logins managed by authentication servers.
- A subculture list for server groups that are not managed by our main master servers
- A friends list and filter for the server browser that shows you only servers with
  your friends on them.
- The client now can handle network traffic while it is waiting for the graphics
  card to swap buffers.
- The dedicated server no longer uses a fixed delay, but a select() call (that
  returns when network data arrives) to idle. When data arrives, it does 
  the minimum amount of work before it sends out the responses, resulting in
  lower latency. It is now safe to decrease DEDICATED_FPS to 20 or 10, latency
  is no longer influenced by that setting.
- Game level lag compensation. When a command arrives from a client that is delayed,
  it is backdated to the time it was issued, provided enough "lag credit" is left.
  The client is informed of the delay so it can compensate in the future, which it does
  by forging the game timer.
- Nonnormalized axes and axes with odd turning directions are now properly supported
- The camera has a memory which player you like to watch. Every time you manually switch
  the camera and your favorite player is not dead, the favorite is set to the currently 
  watched player. The next time the camera doesn't know what to watch, your favorite
  will be selected.
- Players leaving to spectator mode with <0.2.8.2 clients are handled like
  spectators of 0.2.8.2 clients: they stay visible to the others.
- Kick statistics are now persistent across server runs.
- MESSAGE_OF_DAY is now displayed fullscreen if both server and client support it
- Manual fullscreen messages can be triggered with
  FULLSCREEN_MESSAGE <timeout> <message content>
- Axes Indicators by meriton, can be enabled using the AXES_INDICATORS
  setting.
- New "About" menu item in the main menu displays the version of
  Armagetron Advanced, the paths it uses, links to the main site, wiki
  and forums and the names of the project admins.
- New entries in ladderlog.txt:
  - GAME_TIME <time> (only if enabled via the LADDERLOG_GAME_TIME_INTERVAL
    setting): The time that has passed since the last start of a round
  - BASEZONE_CONQUERED <team> <x> <y>: A fortress zone belonging to <team>
    at the coordinates (<x>, <y>) has been conquered
  - BASEZONE_CONQUERER <player>: at the time of the last BASEZONE_CONQUERED
    message, <player> has been in the conquered zone
  - ONLINE_PLAYER <player> [<ping [<team>]]: At the beginning of the round,
    <player> had <ping> and was on <team>. This line is not printed for bots
  - NUM_HUMANS <n>: There are <n> players that are not AIs and are part of a
    team.
  - ROUND_SCORE has the player's team name appended.
  - ROUND_SCORE_TEAM: score a team accumulated during the last round.
  - WAIT_FOR_EXTENAL_SCRIPT: printed if the setting of the same name is
    enabled. In this case the server will delay the start of the next round
    until WAIT_FOR_EXTENAL_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT is reached or the setting is
    disabled.
- Wrapped console lines are indented by an amount of spaces that can be
  specified using the setting CONSOLE_INDENT.
- /help command that supports multiple help topics. Use
  HELP_INTRODUCTORY_BLURB and ADD_HELP_TOPIC to control its contents
- /rtfm command that allows moderators to send help messages to newbies
- /players now shows the players' color and allows searching
- TEAM_ELIMINATION_MODE sets the way ArmagetronAd removes teams when there's too much teams.

  Bugfixes:
- Added compensation for drifting timers (observed often with
  overclocked mainboards)
- Text input fields now let the text wrap correctly and make use of the space allocated
  for them in a not-completely-dumb way. And *sigh* depending on the text field, color
  codes are either ignored (for the usernames) or both displayed in text and rendered.
- "KICK 2pack" no longer kicks user 2 instead of player 2pack.
- Fixed various trail end related extrapolation/simulation inaccuracies that looked
  like lag.
- When extrapolating, the game's sensors never detected own or teammates' walls,
  it mistook them for enemy walls.
- The acceleration and boost system always used settings for enemy walls instead of
  settings for team players' walls. That means that old clients connecting to a
  0.2.8.3+ server that has CYCLE_ACCEL_ENEMY and CYCLE_ACCEL_TEAM set to different
  values experience syncing problems. The default behavior therefore is to lock 0.2.8.2
  and earlier out of your server if you set one of them away from the default. 
  If you want to set both accelerations away from the default, but to the same value,
  there won't be a compatibility problem; in that case, set CYCLE_ACCEL_ENEMY_OVERRIDE
  and CYCLE_ACCEL_TEAM_OVERRIDE to 0 and old clients will be allowed in. However, you
  should manually lock out players with 0.2.7 clients, for example by modifying
  CYCLE_ACCEL_RIM a tiny bit.
- "Team Red" bug. If the server allows maximally two teams, no team ever
  gets to be Team Red.
- Phasing made even more difficult; nice side effect of the fix is
  reduced network bandwidth usage.
- Speed gauge resets between rounds.
- More accurate Lag-O-Meter by meriton.
- Zones were sometimes invisible.

  Internals:
- A complete netsync cycle is now sn_Receive(); nNetObject::SyncAll(); sn_SendPlanned();.
- Ping charity is now completely server controlled.

Changes since 0.2.8.1:
- Timestamps and teamscores added to scorelog.txt
- Dedicated server now works on FreeBSD and OpenBSD
- User running the dedicated server is called "armagetronad" again, the
  longer "armagetronad-dedicated" caused problems with BSD
- Test versions refuse to connect to servers more than one version ahead
- Prepared client for respawns
- Team spawn formation is now configurable
- Added reasons to bans
- Added spectator autokicking
- Added history to chat and console (wrtlprnft). Press "Cursor up" to
  edit and repeat previous chats and console commands.
- You only enter a game once your client is synced
- /msg now prefers exact matches over partial matches
- Cycles now have better memory for pending turns (wrtlprnft)
- Added player join/leave/rename messages to ladderlog.txt with IPs
- Ping variance influence on packet loss tolerance code is now clamped
  by the regular, configurable, packet loss tolerance: effect of variance
  can be no bigger than the effect of ping.
- Spectators are now regular players and can chat
- The /msg command now converts the entered pattern into the internal
  name so if you write "/msg צה" and there is a user named "צה" with
  an internal nick of "oau" it will still get matched
- Team changes are now only executed when allowed, the need for the 
  temporary/permanent team imbalance setting distinction has gone away
- Added brake toggle button
  Bugfixes:
- Client sometimes crashed when leaving a server with AIs on over the menu
- The server starting scripts were chowning /var/run and /var/log to armagetronad
- Short names could crash the server
- Direct cycle collisions sometimes lead to both passing trough each other
- Init scripts now installed correctly with --enable-initscripts
- Hopeless pending team change wishes are deleted

- Large speed boosts out of game rule bounds were possible during network
  glitches
- Debug recording reliability increased, function call with undefined return
  value eliminated
- Recording and scorekeeping no longer conflict
- Input during a recording now has an end marker, making quick keypresses
  after leaving a menu not break it
- CYCLE_RUBBER_DELAY was overridden sometimes by packet loss tolerance
- ALLOW_CONTROL_DURING_CHAT now ignores modifier keys like shift and
  has been reactivated
- The camera sometimes got stuck in free mode for the first round you watch
- Crashfix in hole blowing code when no cycle was set
- After a "perfect" 180, you're more often on the right side of your own wall
  That code caused some havoc at first, so it has been reworked
- The smart cam did not like fluctuating framerates
- Improved debug recording reliability: multiple master server visits
  and too quick keypresses were causing trouble.
- Canonical DESTDIR support and added ROOTDIR support for testing
- Login floods are detected and ignored
- Player name updates sanitized
- Disabled complicated feasibility tests for team menu entries, 
  they did not have the full information and were often wrong
- Team score only added to player score if no teamplay is possible

Changes since 0.2.8.0:

  This is undocumented and unsupported.
- The server browser now shows a B beside the score to mark bookmarked servers.
 Bugfixes:
- -Os compile option is filtered out if GCC 3.3 is used, it makes the build go bad.
- Extremely low values of CYCLE_DELAY were not honored, an arbitrary delay of .005s
  was added to it.
- On entering a server, the camera would sometimes be stuck in free mode.

Changes since 0.2.8.0_rc2:
- Almost final artwork
- Moviepacks can now also contain texture replacements for the default cycle model
- Added number of teammates alive to HUD
  Bugfixes:
- Dual textured floor rendering is now disabled without alpha blending as it
  did not work anyway.
- Lag-O-Meter now has the correct size (the old, buggy one can be restored by
  setting LAG_O_METER_SCALE to .5).

  Cycle turns are now executed more accurately on the server.
  Timer stuttering at end of round (was non-critical, but ugly).
  Custom camera did not turn when the internal camera was
  configured not to turn.
  Idle player kick code crashed when it kicked a client with
  many players.
  The code that removes inactive players after a while removed
  the AI players.
- Reverted smart camera movement to pre-beta4 behavior,
  the new code made some players seasick :)
- Ingame admin interface gives more useful information to the invoker 
- Small font rendering improvements
- Zone conquest message, if it is not the one that ends the round,
  now states the name of the zone owning team.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta4.2:
- Fixed bugs:
  Random client disconnection
  Another vote-not-appearing-on-client bug
  Invisible wall segments right after turn
  Arena initialization before all settings are transmitted from the server
  The server was using more rubber than the client sometimes
  Crash with moviepack and some maps

  Windows version had a memory overwrite error causing crashes and weird behavior.
  The game quit when the chat key and a key bound to an instant chat were pressed to quickly.
  Votes expired too early on the client.
  Performance: a lot of unused temporary walls were hanging around each round.
  Cycles sometimes warped to odd locations.
- Tweaked smart camera to not stay in front of the cycle so much.
  Tweaked smart camera custom glancing.
  Report back whether you like or hate it!
- Made custom camera even more configurable, changed default settings.
  (old ones are still in settings.cfg)
- Forced glancing end on cycle turn now looks better.
- FOV settings now deal better with wide screens/splitscreen mode.
- Increased ping measurements again by adding the fluctuations. The raw 
  average ping caused the game logic to be too picky.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta3:
- Famous fixed bugs: 
  Random huge felt lag or blank screen (it was actually a problem with the timer) is gone.
  Bogus "possible phase bug" message.
  Seemingly random walls popping out of nothing, only to disappear a second later.
  Random camera focus changes while you were still alive.
  Every 100th console line got deleted.
- Reduced pings! Actually, just the measurement is improved, the actual latency
  stays the same. I hope nobody notices that. Good thing nobody reads NEWS files :)
- New text editing convenience: Home and end keys work, and CTRL+left/right/del/backspace
  work on whole words. Thanks, Nemo!
- New instant chat functions: There are now 25 instant chat strings. If an instant
  chat string ends in a \, it will not be sent immediately, it's opened to be edited by you.
  Pressing an instant chat key while already chatting will insert the string, provided the
  key does not produce a regular character.
- If enabled by the server administrator: control your cycle while you chat.
- Turning speed of custom and internal camera can be adjusted with CAMERA_CUSTOM_TURN_SPEED
  and CAMERA_IN_TURN_SPEED.
- The custom camera zooms out from a closeup at round start. Useful to see your position
  in your team. Configurable with CAMERA_CUSTOM_ZOOM.
- Master server redundancy enabled. Thanks to Lucifer for hosting the backup master!

Changes since 0.2.8_beta2:
- More bugfixes: most annoying was the crash/infinite loop a server got in when
  the master server was unreachable
- Added zones to map specification
- Reworked top level map format (sorry to the map makers for the inconvenience)
- Windows: added start menu entries that open the system and user data directories
- Bandwidth limitation now works. That means if you lowered the bandwidth
  limits in the network setup, they were not respected. You probably should
  readjust them.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta1:
- bugfixes, of course
- added recording and playback startmenu entries for Windows
- abuse prevention: added IP banning, player number per IP and client limit, 
  doublebinding can be crippled on server command

Changes since 0.2.7.1:
- Server side cycle synchronization issues fixed:
  destination removal fixed
  lag sliding caused by different interpretation of grinding turn commands on client and server fixed
  niceness for older clients: sync interval decreased, no sync in front of wall to prevent local tunneling
- Client side cycle synchronization issues fixed:
  smooth corrections now only affect the appearance, the correct values are used internally
  sync messages are no longer ignored,
  new extrapolating sync method implemented,
  ghosting fixed,
  wall ends sticking out fixed ( for enemy cycles ),
  the sophisticated distance based sync code implemented years ago is now actually used, oh dear.

- added support for nonorthogonal driving directions
- added support for debug recording and playback
