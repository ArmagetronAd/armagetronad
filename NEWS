Featurelets
-----------

- /teams chat command that rougly prints team layout.
- Added Polish language file
- clientside play time tracking and server controlled minimal required experience
  to be allowed to play.
- color codes in chat increase the spam level logarithmically.
- /team messages get a reduced spam level; reduction factor is given by 
  (team size)/(number of total players).
- /team messages can be used by spectators to chat with other spectators only.
- Performance optimizations. Using OpenGL display lists to cache geometry.
- Removed ztrick, antialiasing and perspective correction settings. They all had only one right
  setting and caused us some interesting bug reports.
- Added PLAYER_RANDOM_COLOR for lazy people who just want to have a
  color that differs from everyone else on the server.
- Configuration files get reloaded on SIGHUP
- all admin commands now also accept partial name matches, like /msg, and check for case sensitive
  matches in the screen name first, then the user name, then case insensitive matches in the two.
- --enable-krawallserver has been actually implemented now, and it enables secure logins
  to accounts local to the server and not-so-secure logins managed by authentication servers.
- A subculture list for server groups that are not managed by our main master servers
- A friends list and filter for the server browser that shows you only servers with
  your friends on them.
- The client now can handle network traffic while it is waiting for the graphics
  card to swap buffers.
- The dedicated server no longer uses a fixed delay, but a select() call (that
  returns when network data arrives) to idle. When data arrives, it does 
  the minimum amount of work before it sends out the responses, resulting in
  lower latency. It is now safe to decrease DEDICATED_FPS to 20 or 10, latency
  is no longer influenced by that setting.
- Game level lag compensation. When a command arrives from a client that is delayed,
  it is backdated to the time it was issued, provided enough "lag credit" is left.
  The client is informed of the delay so it can compensate in the future, which it does
  by forging the game timer.
- Nonnormalized axes and axes with odd turning directions are now properly supported
- The camera has a memory which player you like to watch. Every time you manually switch
  the camera and your favorite player is not dead, the favorite is set to the currently 
  watched player. The next time the camera doesn't know what to watch, your favorite
  will be selected.
- Players leaving to spectator mode with <0.2.8.2 clients are handled like
  spectators of 0.2.8.2 clients: they stay visible to the others.
- Kick statistics are now persistent across server runs.
- MESSAGE_OF_DAY is now displayed fullscreen if both server and client support it
- Manual fullscreen messages can be triggered with
  FULLSCREEN_MESSAGE <timeout> <message content>
- Axes Indicators by meriton, can be enabled using the AXES_INDICATORS
  setting.
- New "About" menu item in the main menu displays the version of
  Armagetron Advanced, the paths it uses, links to the main site, wiki
  and forums and the names of the project admins.
- New entries in ladderlog.txt:
  - GAME_TIME <time> (only if enabled via the LADDERLOG_GAME_TIME_INTERVAL
    setting): The time that has passed since the last start of a round
  - BASEZONE_CONQUERED <team> <x> <y>: A fortress zone belonging to <team>
    at the coordinates (<x>, <y>) has been conquered
  - BASEZONE_CONQUERER <player>: at the time of the last BASEZONE_CONQUERED
    message, <player> has been in the conquered zone
  - ONLINE_PLAYER <player> [<ping [<team>]]: At the beginning of the round,
    <player> had <ping> and was on <team>. This line is not printed for bots
  - NUM_HUMANS <n>: There are <n> players that are not AIs and are part of a
    team.
  - ROUND_SCORE has the player's team name appended.
  - ROUND_SCORE_TEAM: score a team accumulated during the last round.
  - WAIT_FOR_EXTENAL_SCRIPT: printed if the setting of the same name is
    enabled. In this case the server will delay the start of the next round
    until WAIT_FOR_EXTENAL_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT is reached or the setting is
    disabled.
- Wrapped console lines are indented by an amount of spaces that can be
  specified using the setting CONSOLE_INDENT.
- /help command that supports multiple help topics. Use
  HELP_INTRODUCTORY_BLURB and ADD_HELP_TOPIC to control its contents
- /rtfm command that allows moderators to send help messages to newbies
- /players now shows the players' color and allows searching
- TEAM_ELIMINATION_MODE sets the way ArmagetronAd removes teams when there's too much teams.

Bugfixes
--------

- Added compensation for drifting timers (observed often with
  overclocked mainboards)
- Text input fields now let the text wrap correctly and make use of the space allocated
  for them in a not-completely-dumb way. And *sigh* depending on the text field, color
  codes are either ignored (for the usernames) or both displayed in text and rendered.
- "KICK 2pack" no longer kicks user 2 instead of player 2pack.
- Fixed various trail end related extrapolation/simulation inaccuracies that looked
  like lag.
- When extrapolating, the game's sensors never detected own or teammates' walls,
  it mistook them for enemy walls.
- The acceleration and boost system always used settings for enemy walls instead of
  settings for team players' walls. That means that old clients connecting to a
  0.2.8.3+ server that has CYCLE_ACCEL_ENEMY and CYCLE_ACCEL_TEAM set to different
  values experience syncing problems. The default behavior therefore is to lock 0.2.8.2
  and earlier out of your server if you set one of them away from the default. 
  If you want to set both accelerations away from the default, but to the same value,
  there won't be a compatibility problem; in that case, set CYCLE_ACCEL_ENEMY_OVERRIDE
  and CYCLE_ACCEL_TEAM_OVERRIDE to 0 and old clients will be allowed in. However, you
  should manually lock out players with 0.2.7 clients, for example by modifying
  CYCLE_ACCEL_RIM a tiny bit.
- "Team Red" bug. If the server allows maximally two teams, no team ever
  gets to be Team Red.
- Phasing made even more difficult; nice side effect of the fix is
  reduced network bandwidth usage.
- Speed gauge resets between rounds.
- More accurate Lag-O-Meter by meriton.
- Zones were sometimes invisible.

Internals
---------

- A complete netsync cycle is now sn_Receive(); nNetObject::SyncAll(); sn_SendPlanned();.
- Ping charity is now completely server controlled.

Changes since 0.2.8.1
=====================

- Timestamps and teamscores added to scorelog.txt
- Dedicated server now works on FreeBSD and OpenBSD

  longer "armagetronad-dedicated" caused problems with BSD
- Test versions refuse to connect to servers more than one version ahead
- Prepared client for respawns
- Team spawn formation is now configurable

  by the regular, configurable, packet loss tolerance: effect of variance
  can be no bigger than the effect of ping.
- Spectators are now regular players and can chat
- The /msg command now converts the entered pattern into the internal
  name so if you write "/msg öäü" and there is a user named "öäü" with
  an internal nick of "oau" it will still get matched
- Team changes are now only executed when allowed, the need for the
  temporary/permanent team imbalance setting distinction has gone away
- Added brake toggle button
  Bugfixes:

- Votes expired too early on the client.
- Performance: a lot of unused temporary walls were hanging around each round.
- Cycles sometimes warped to odd locations.

- Tweaked smart camera to not stay in front of the cycle so much.

  (old ones are still in settings.cfg)
- Forced glancing end on cycle turn now looks better.

  average ping caused the game logic to be too picky.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta3
==========================

Famous fixed bugs
-----------------

- Random huge felt lag or blank screen (it was actually a problem with the timer) is gone.
- Bogus "possible phase bug" message.
- Seemingly random walls popping out of nothing, only to disappear a second later.
- Random camera focus changes while you were still alive.
- Every 100th console line got deleted.

- Reduced pings! Actually, just the measurement is improved, the actual latency
  stays the same. I hope nobody notices that. Good thing nobody reads NEWS files :)
- New text editing convenience: Home and end keys work, and CTRL+left/right/del/backspace
  work on whole words. Thanks, Nemo!
- New instant chat functions: There are now 25 instant chat strings. If an instant
  chat string ends in a \, it will not be sent immediately, it's opened to be edited by you.
  Pressing an instant chat key while already chatting will insert the string, provided the
  key does not produce a regular character.
- If enabled by the server administrator: control your cycle while you chat.
- Turning speed of custom and internal camera can be adjusted with CAMERA_CUSTOM_TURN_SPEED
  and CAMERA_IN_TURN_SPEED.
- The custom camera zooms out from a closeup at round start. Useful to see your position
  in your team. Configurable with CAMERA_CUSTOM_ZOOM.
- Master server redundancy enabled. Thanks to Lucifer for hosting the backup master!

  readjust them.

Changes since 0.2.8_beta1
=========================
