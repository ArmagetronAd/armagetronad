In this file you find instructions how to get from a fresh Subversion checkout
to a running game. It is assumed that you know how to check out modules on
your system, because you apparently already managed to check out one :)

"Checking out module X in parallel to this" means you should go to the parent
directory and check out module X from the same repository where you got this
module from, so that the parent directory looks like this::

	parent_directory:
	    armagetronad:
	        README-Subversion and other files
	    X:
	        files from X

To use the sources from Subversion, you need to have additional tools
installed: on all operating systems, you'll need Python (www.python.org). On
Unix, you also need all autotools (autoconf and automake, check with your
distribution). To build tarball distributions, you also need a 'svn' command
line tool that can generate ChangeLogs.


Unix vanilla
=============

You're in luck, you already have everything you'll need. Follow these steps::

	# generate configure, config.h.in and the like
	> sh ./bootstrap.sh
	# generate and change to build directory
	> mkdir ../armagetronad-build && cd ../armagetronad-build
	# run the configure script (add --disable-glout for the dedicated server)
	> ../armagetronad/configure
	# run make
	> make
	# run game
	> make run
	# or run with arguments
	> ./src/armagetronad_main <options>
	# install game if you like
	> make install

Unix managed
============

There is also a helper module for the unix build, managing the tasks above and
managing debug and optimized versions of the client and the server. It is
designed to operate with the Eclipse IDE, but runs fine without it. The
module's name is armagetronad_build_eclipse. Check it out parallel to the
armagetronad module, cd there and read the enclosed README. If you're in a
hurry, just run "make" there.

KDevelop 3.0
============

1. First, you need to bootstrap. Execute: sh ./bootstrap.sh
2. Run 'kdevelop' if you haven't done so already.
3. From the Project menu, choose Open Project. Select 'armagetron.kdevelop' 
   and press OK
4. From the Build menu, choose Run Configure

If all goes smoothly, you can now edit Armagetron Advanced and run it.

Mac OS X
========

The Mac OS project is located in the armagetronad/MacOS/ directory.

Armagetron Advanced.xcodeproj will only open in Xcode >= 2.4. It has these targets:
* Armagetron Advanced -- The client
* Armagetron Advanced Dedicated -- Dedicated Server
  
All required libraries required to build Armagetron Advanced for Mac OS X may
be download from the the Sourceforge project page:

https://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110997&package_id=266788

Aditional Required Software
---------------------------

If you are running Mac OS X 10.5 then nothing else is required.

If you are running 10.4 then you must install:

* rake: macports name rb-rake. http://rake.rubyforge.org
* bison: macports name bison. http://www.gnu.org/software/bison

You must also add a user-defined setting in Xcode, BISON. Its value should
be the path of the newly installed bison.


Windows + VisualC
=================
You'll need to check out the additional module build_visualc parallel to this
module. In it, you'll find a README describing how to proceed; you'll need to
download some libraries and put them in the right place.

Windows + Cygwin
================

Not supported yet.

Windows + Mingw
===============

Not supported yet.
