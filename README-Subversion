In this file you find instructions how to get from a fresh Subversion checkout
to a running game. It is assumed that you know how to check out modules on
your system, because you apparently already managed to check out one :)

"Checking out module X in parallel to this" means you should go to the parent
directory and check out module X from the same repository where you got this
module from, so that the parent directory looks like this::


	parent_directory:
	    armagetronad:
	        README-Subversion and other files
	    X:
	        files from X

To use the sources from Subversion, you need to have additional tools
installed: on all operating systems, you'll need Python (www.python.org). On
Unix, you also need all autotools (autoconf and automake, check with your
distribution). To build tarball distributions, you also need a 'svn' command
line tool that can generate ChangeLogs.

The instructions also apply if you're using BZR to fetch the sources;
there, 'modules' are just individual branches named
0.2.8-<modulename>-work.

Unix vanilla
=============

You're in luck, you already have everything you'll need. Follow these steps::

	# generate configure, config.h.in and the like
	> sh ./bootstrap.sh
	# generate and change to build directory
	> mkdir ../armagetronad-build && cd ../armagetronad-build
	# run the configure script (add --disable-glout for the dedicated server)
	> ../armagetronad/configure
	# run make
	> make
	# run game
	> make run
	# or run with arguments
	> ./src/armagetronad_main <options>
	# install game if you like
	> make install

Unix managed
============

There is also a helper module for the unix build, managing the tasks above and
managing debug and optimized versions of the client and the server. It is
designed to operate with the Eclipse IDE, but runs fine without it. The
module's name is armagetronad_build_eclipse. Check it out parallel to the
armagetronad module, cd there and read the enclosed README. If you're in a
hurry, just run "make" there.

KDevelop 3.0
============

(No longer supported)

1. First, you need to bootstrap. Execute: sh ./bootstrap.sh
2. Run 'kdevelop' if you haven't done so already.
3. From the Project menu, choose Open Project. Select 'armagetron.kdevelop' 
   and press OK
4. From the Build menu, choose Run Configure

If all goes smoothly, you can now edit Armagetron Advanced and run it.

OS X
====

You will need to install:

* Xcode and Command Line Tools
* Automake and autoconf
* The OS X toolkit <https://code.launchpad.net/~dlh/armagetronad/os-x-toolkit>

Follow the Unix vanilla instructions for how to build the game. You will need to
use the --with-os-x-toolkit configure option. This option needs the OS X toolkit
directory to be provided, either as an argument to the configure option or by the
ARMAGETRONAD_OS_X_TOOLKIT environment variable.

Call "make install" to create a stand-alone .app (for the client), or a stand-alone
directory (for the dedicated server). The installed game will be created in the
build directory.

* Windows + Mingw *

Supported via the Code::Blocks IDE. Specific instructions are in win32/README.txt.
