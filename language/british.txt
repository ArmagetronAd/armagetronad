player_num_per_team_help          Set your favourite number of players per team here. When you join a game and the smallest team has less players than specified here, you'll join that team. Otherwise, you will create a new team. Only the default behaviour is governed by this setting; you can switch teams later.

screen_colordepth_text            Colour Depth:
screen_colordepth_help            Choose the colour depth you want \g to run at. You have to exit and re-enter \g or select "Apply Changes" for this to have an effect. 
screen_colordepth_desk_help       Your system's default colour depth; usually the same you have on your desktop.
screen_zdepth_desk_help           Take z buffer depth from colour depth; this is the most compatible option.
screen_zdepth_32_help             Force 32 bit z-buffer. If it works, it will improve the quality in 16 bit colour depth.
screen_truecolor_help             If active, so become 24 bit color depth used, else 16 bit. Some older systems supply only in 16 bit acceptable performance, on the other hand must the color depth here match with the Desktop-color depth.
detail_dither_help                If the colour depth of your current
graphic mode does not directly allow the colour that is to be drawn, it is
simulated by mixing other colours. Turning it off will improve software rendering performance on some systems; in low resolution modes, turning it off will even improve the visual quality (IMHO).
detail_smooth_help                Makes edges appear "round" by adding a colour gradient to the surfaces. Even software rendering is not slowed down by activating this.
detail_text_truecolor_text        TrueColour Textures:
detail_text_truecolor_help        Stores the textures with 32 bit colour depth instead of the default of 16 bit.
sound_inited                      Sound initialised: 16 bit stereo at \1 Hz, buffer size \2 samples.\n
