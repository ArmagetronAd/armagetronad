swapoptimize_text           Optimize Swap for:
swapoptimize_help           Determines the algorithm used on buffer swaps and syncs.
swapoptimize_latency_text   Low Latency
swapoptimize_latency_help   This optimizes for low latency between input and display (also known as input lag).
swapoptimize_auto_text       Automatic
swapoptimize_auto_help       This choses low latency mode if your framerate appears stable and high enough and falls into throughput mode if too many frames are dropped or framerates are so high that latency is not a problem anyway. Recommended setting.
swapoptimize_throughput_text Throughput
swapoptimize_throughput_help This optimizes for high FPS counts and low number of dropped frames, but keeps input lag below one frame anyway.
swapoptimize_throughput_flush_text Throughput+Flush
swapoptimize_throughput_flush_help This optimizes for high FPS counts and low number of dropped frames. It uses pipeline flush commands instead of proper sync commands which causes various amounts of input lag on some systems, so beware.
swapoptimize_throughput_fastest_text Overhead
swapoptimize_throughput_fastest_help This optimizes low sync overhead. It does not flush the rendering pipeline at all. Expect insane amounts of input lag and performance drops due to inconveniently timed pipeline stalls.
swap_optimize_help          Determines the algorithm used to swap and sync. 0: Optimize for low latency, 1: Auto, 2: optimize for high throughput, 3 and 4 optimize even more for throughput, but are very dangerous.

framedrop_tolerance_lenient_help Expect about one dropped frame every twenty seconds.

framedrop_tolerance_normal_text Normal
framedrop_tolerance_normal_help Expect one dropped frame per minute.

framedrop_tolerance_draconic_text Draconic
framedrop_tolerance_draconic_help Do not tolerate any unnecessary framedrops.

framedrop_tolerance_help Controls the amount of dropped frames tolerated for the sake of lower latency in Latency swap mode. 0 tolerates the most, 4 the least.

swap_latency_delay_factor_help   Safety factor for calculating the delay after swaps in Latency Swap mode. Between 0 and 1, don't touch, it gets adapted automatically according to your FRAMEDROP_TOLERANCE setting.

tutorial_menu_grind_instructions Walls are also your friend in \g. You can drive close to a cycle trail to accelerate. If you are driving so close to a wall that you see sparks fly, you're doing it right.\nUse that to beat the enemy AI in a race to the winzone up ahead.

tutorial_menu_conquest_text     Conquest
tutorial_menu_conquest_help     Conquest Tutorial: learn to conquer a fortress.
tutorial_menu_conquest_instructions The goal of the Fortress mode is to conquer the enemy zone and defend your own zone. Unlike the winzones you saw earlier, a simple touch is not enough; you have to stay inside the zone and keep defenders out for a few seconds.\nIn this excercise, you will try to attack the enemy Gold zone, your home zone is safe. You will need to find a way past the lone defender or kill it.\n\nSadly, Fortress mode is not available for local play against AIs. We don't have any good AIs for it yet.

tutorial_menu_teamstart_text     Team Start
tutorial_menu_teamstart_help     Team Start Tutorial: learn the standard team formation opening move
tutorial_menu_teamstart_instructions If you play in a team, it usually is the best startup move to tightly grind each others walls. The outside players should cuddle up on the center player, the ones further outside doing so in several steps. This tutorial puts you in the most difficult position there is, the player next to the outer player. Survive the start and don't let anyone on your team die.
tutorial_menu_teamstart_animation textures/tutorials/teamstart/teamstart.txt
tutorial_fail_backdoor            Failure: Follow the other cycles.

tutorial_menu_doublegrind_text     Double Grind
tutorial_menu_doublegrind_help     Double Grind Tutorial: learn the other standard team formation opening move
tutorial_menu_doublegrind_instructions In many configurations, a modification of the standard team formation called 'double grinding' is of advantage: the two players next to the center do not grind it immediately. Instead, they go straight for a bit, then turn back, then forward again. They grind the center player twice, hence the name. This gives them extra time between two cycle trails and thus extra acceleration. Your job as a player right next to one of them is to supply that extra trail. Do not grind the center too hard or you will kill the double grinder.\nThe double grinding itself takes practice to do right and the exact timing depends a lot on the configuration, so we can't teach it here. Don't worry, it is mostly optional.
tutorial_menu_doublegrind_animation textures/tutorials/doublegrind/doublegrind.txt

tutorial_menu_speedkill_text     Speed Kill
tutorial_menu_speedkill_help     Speed Kill: learn to use a speed advantage to trap an enemy
tutorial_menu_speedkill_instructions The speed kill is the most basic way to get rid of your enemies in \g. You sneak up on them, grinding their trail, and after you overtake them, you cut them off and wrap them in your tail.\nHere, we set you up for an easy speed kill against an oblivious AI.
tutorial_menu_speedkill_animation textures/tutorials/speedkill/speedkill.txt

tutorial_menu_speedkilldefense_text     Speed Kill Defense
tutorial_menu_speedkilldefense_help     Defense: learn how to defend against speed kills
tutorial_menu_speedkilldefense_instructions Oh no! Now the situation is reversed. An enemy is grinding your tail on the right hand side and is going to cut you off in a moment. Quick, think of a counter!
tutorial_menu_speedkilldefense_animation textures/tutorials/speedkilldefense/speedkilldefense.txt

tutorial_menu_congratulations_text     Closing Words
tutorial_menu_congratulations_help     Not everything can be taught in tutorials.
tutorial_menu_congratulations_instructions Congratulations, you should now have completed all the essential tutorials. What follows here are optional challenges. You are now ready to enter the proper game, which is the online multiplayer component. Before you dive into that, there are a couple of things you should know about the online community and server landscape:\n\nYou can scroll this and other messages of this kind up and down using the cursor up and down keys.\n\nSumo Mode: You were taught the basics of Fortress mode here; Sumo uses the same basic mechanics, only usually for single players and not teams, and the zones of several competing players are put right on top of each other. And they shrink.\n\nCapture the Flag (CTF): Some servers offer this classic game mode, with a small zone standing in as the flag and a bigger one serving as base to return the flag to.\n\nAlso, It is best to read over the included documentation (use the Help menu to launch it in a browser). And you should definitely stick to basic game modes and close-to-default settings at first. The server browser helps you with that by hiding advanced servers from immediate view initially; you can still enter them early if you dare.

tutorial_menu_highrubber_text         Showcase: High Rubber
tutorial_menu_highrubber_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_highrubber_instructions Remember how in the early tutorials, you could touch walls without exlpoding immediately? We call this 'rubber' for historical reasons. Some servers ramp up that rubber setting really high and also reduce the delay between cycle turns so it gets harder to die.\n\nOther human players you meet on high rubber servers will usually do tight moves close to walls in tiny corridors; it's impossible to read these and find a way out after they are built, so you need to watch the players themselves.\n\nIt may be helpful (but not required if you have quick fingers) if you 'doublebind': go to your input configuration and bind the turn commands to two keys, then press those at the same time during the game. You will make an instant 180 degree turn.\n\nAs always, kill all AIs.

tutorial_menu_brakeboost_text         Showcase: Brake Boost
tutorial_menu_brakeboost_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_brakeboost_instructions One of the strengths of \g are the various gameplay configurations it allows. These showcases prepare you for a little bit of the insanity you will encounter online.\n\nFirst, a simple one: The brake can be reconfigured to act as a speed boost. Use it to obliterate the AIs.

tutorial_menu_open_text         Showcase: Open Play
tutorial_menu_open_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_open_instructions This challenge has you playing in a high rubber environment where you cannot grind too tightly; you are forced to leave a gap. If someone wants to follow you, though, they will always be able to squeeze through that gap. Naturally, this makes it very hard to kill someone properly.\n\nTry do do so anyway, eliminate the AIs.\n\n\nSome servers you find online enforce this style of play not via settings used here, but by policy. You are expected to voluntarily leave a gap for trapped players to try and escape through.

tutorial_menu_turbo_text         Showcase: High Speed
tutorial_menu_turbo_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_turbo_instructions Some servers will have you racing at ludicrous speed or, which is the same from a gameplay perspective, confined to a very small arena.\n\nSurvive. The AIs will probably suicide within seconds.

tutorial_menu_map_text         Showcase: Maps
tutorial_menu_map_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_map_instructions Not all battles are fought on rectangular arenas. Some have obstacles, passages and traps. This is one of them.\n\nGet the AIs.

tutorial_menu_axes_text         Showcase: Betrayal
tutorial_menu_axes_help         Prepares you for some of the weird settings out there.
tutorial_menu_axes_instructions When we said you can only make 90 degree turns, we lied. In this showcase, you make 45 degree turns.\n\nSurvive the AIs. Interestingly, the easiest way to do so is to let them try and trap you and fail miserably.

screen_check_errors_help	Should we listen to the warnings about non-existent video modes during initialisation? Usually, you should leave this option alone.

screen_use_sdl_text		Use SDL OpenGL:
screen_use_sdl_help		Toggles use of the clean OpenGL initialisation routines; if disabled, \g will use the dirty method that was necessary with SDL 1.0.

screen_vsync_text		VSync:
screen_vsync_help		What to do with the monitor's vertical sync signal.

screen_vsync_on_text	Wait
screen_vsync_on_help	Wait for it every frame. This usually results in very smooth animations at a frame rate limited by your monitor's refresh rate, and is the only way to make this game not use 100% CPU time. Recommended.

screen_vsync_default_text	Default
screen_vsync_default_help	Do not touch the system defaults.

screen_vsync_off_text	Don't wait
screen_vsync_off_help	Ignore the signal. This results in higher frame rates, but you won't see most of these frames; your monitor can't display them all. Usually a waste of resources and causes tearing artefacts.

screen_vsync_motionblur_text	Motion Blur
screen_vsync_motionblur_help	Ignore it and make use of the additional frames for motion blurring, which makes the tearing artefacts less prominent. Recommended for power gamers.

screen_vsync_motionblur_unsupported	Motion Blur unsupported on your system, disabling it.\n

screen_grab_mouse_text		Grab Mouse:
screen_grab_mouse_help		If activated, the mouse pointer is centered after every move; thus, it is unable to leave the window. This option is only useful when you play \g in a window.

screen_apply_changes_text	Apply Changes
screen_apply_changes_help	Tries to enable the settings in this menu without exiting \g. Use at your own risk.

screen_keep_window_active_text   Keep Window Active
screen_keep_window_active_help   This toggles if \g should stay active when window mode is selected and \g loses focus.

#detail menu
detail_floor_mirror_text	Floor Mirror:
detail_floor_mirror_help	Which objects should have reflections on the floor?

detail_floor_mirror_off_text	Off
detail_floor_mirror_off_help	None

detail_floor_mirror_obj_text	Objects only
detail_floor_mirror_obj_help	All moving objects

detail_floor_mirror_ow_text	Objects and Walls
detail_floor_mirror_ow_help	Everything that is important in the game

detail_floor_mirror_ev_text	Everything!
detail_floor_mirror_ev_help	(Currently no difference to "Objects and Walls".)

detail_simple_trail_text    Simple Trails:
detail_simple_trail_help    If activated, cycle trails are displayed in a simplified form without the buildup after the cycle.

detail_dither_text		Dithering:
detail_dither_help		If the colour depth of your current graphic mode does not directly allow the colour that is to be drawn, it is simulated by mixing other colours. Turning it of will improve software rendering performance on some systems; in low resolution modes, turning it off will even improve the visual quality (IMHO).

detail_floor_text		Floor Detail:
detail_floor_help		\g has several ways to draw the floor and the grid; the better looking ones will cost you some FPS (Frames Per Second).

detail_floor_no_text		No Floor
detail_floor_no_help		Draw nothing at all. Fastest possibility.

detail_floor_grid_text		Just Grid
detail_floor_grid_help		Only a grid of lines is drawn. This option is your choice if you use software rendering.

detail_floor_tex_text		Textured Plane
detail_floor_tex_help		An infinite plane is drawn, with the texture of the grid painted on it. Recommended for all 3D-card owners. Problem: looking at the horizon, the grid will lose its sharpness too fast.

detail_floor_2tex_text		Dual Texture Plane
detail_floor_2tex_help		Just as in "Textured Plane", the floor is an infinite textured plane. But here, the two groups of lines are drawn in two separate rendering steps, resulting in a much sharper image.

detail_alpha_text		Alpha Blending:
detail_alpha_help		Alpha blending is used to display half-transparent objects such as explosions and the walls rising behind the cycles. It does not cost extra with most 3D-cards, but slows software rendering down quite a bit.

detail_smooth_text		Smooth Shading:
detail_smooth_help		Makes edges appear "round" by adding a colour gradient to the surfaces. Even software rendering is not slowed down by activating this.

detail_text_truecolor_text	TrueColour Textures:
detail_text_truecolor_help	Stores the textures with 32 bit colour depth instead of the default of 16 bit.

#preferences menu

pref_skymove_text		Sky Movement:
pref_skymove_help		Toggles the animation of the lower sky plane.

pref_lowersky_text		Lower Sky:
pref_lowersky_help		Toggles the display of the lower sky plane, a plasma cloud. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_uppersky_text		Upper Sky:
pref_uppersky_help		Toggles the display of the upper sky, a solid plane similar to the floor. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_highrim_text		High Rim:
pref_highrim_help		If enabled, the rim walls will have infinite height. If not, they will be about as high as player walls.

pref_headlight_text		Show Headlight:
pref_headlight_help		Render a headlight in front of each cycle.  Requires support by your video card.

pref_showtime_text		Show Time:
pref_showtime_help		Show the current time of day on the HUD.

pref_show24hour_text    Show 24 Hour Clock:
pref_show24hour_help	Shows the clock as a 24 hour clock, if enabled.  Set this to 'off' to show the clock as a 12 hour clock.

pref_showping_text		Show Ping
pref_showping_help		Shows your ping in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

misc_fps_text			Show FPS:
misc_fps_help			Toggles the display of the current FPS (frames per second) rate in the upper right corner (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

#tweaks menu
tweaks_displaylists_text	Display Lists:
tweaks_displaylists_help	Display lists are a feature of OpenGL for rendering the same thing many times. Some implementations are broken; if you do no see the cycles, you should disable this feature.
tweaks_displaylists_off_text Off
tweaks_displaylists_off_help Don't use display lists at all.
tweaks_displaylists_cac_text Create and Call
tweaks_displaylists_cac_help Use displaylists; Create them and call them directly. This is the recommended way.
tweaks_displaylists_cae_text Create and Execute
tweaks_displaylists_cae_help Use displaylists; Create them and let them be executed while they are filled. The experts say this is slower than Create and Call.

tweaks_infinity_text		Infinity:
tweaks_infinity_help		Some planes (grid, sky...) have an infinite extension; if this feature is enabled, they are really drawn as infinite planes. Some OpenGL renderers do not seem to like this (all Windows versions I have seen...); disable it if the floor or sky textures are screwed up.

fullscreen_message_title        Server Message

network_message_timeout_title	Server does not answer
network_message_timeout_inter	The server you wanted to connect to did not answer for ten seconds.\nIt is probably down or unreachable, or you mistyped its name in the "custom connect" menu.

network_message_dns_error_title	DNS error
network_message_dns_error_inter	The connection name of the server (entered in the Address field) you wanted to connect to does not resolve to an IP address. This either means you mistyped it, that your network is down or that the server no longer is reachable under that name.

network_message_denied_title	Login denied
network_message_denied_inter	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.\nThat usually means it is full.
network_message_denied_inter2	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.

network_message_lateto_title	Timeout
network_message_lateto_inter	Connection to the server was initially successful; however, synchronising the gamestate failed.\nJust try again!

network_message_lostconn_title	Connection lost
network_message_lostconn_inter	The network connection to the server was lost. This may be due to a real network failure (Ethernet-cable plugged out, modem lost link, ...) or because of a server crash (That would be bad, so please send a bug report if it happens.)

network_message_abortconn_title	Connection terminated
network_message_abortconn_inter	The server terminated our connection.

network_master_timeout_retry	One of the master servers did not answer. Trying next one...\n
network_master_timeout_title	Master servers do not answer
network_master_timeout_inter	The master servers could not be reached and the server list could not be updated. You'll browse the old list for now.\n\nThe most likely reason for this is a problem with your network. Please check\n- that you have a working internet connection: point your web browser to www.armagetronad.net to test.\n- that your firewall, if you have one, does not block our traffic. To test whether this is your problem, disable your firewall and try again. If it then works, you should re-enable the firewall, but allow \g traffic specifically: \g uses UDP and usually ports 4533 to 4540. Personal firewalls also have the possibility to block connections based on program names; make sure that armagetronad(.exe) is unblocked.\nIf you don't control parts of the network connection, say because you're at a public WLAN hot spot or in a company or school network, chances are the owner of the network purposefully blocks UDP traffic. You'll need to talk to the owner, then.\nA last possible, but unlikely, cause is that the master server infrastructure is currently down completely. Visit the forums at forums.armagetronad.net or the IRC channel #armagetron on irc.freenode.net to see if anyone else has this problem currently.\n

network_master_denied_title		Master login denied
network_master_denied_inter		The master server denied your login attempt. That usually means it is full. Try again later.

testing_version_expired_title   Version Expired
testing_version_expired         You are running a public test version and the server you tried to connect to is running a much newer version and that combination is only supported for major releases. Proceed at your own risk.
