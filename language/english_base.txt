screen_zdepth_desk_help		Take z buffer depth from colour depth; this is the most compatible option.

screen_zdepth_32_text		32 Bit
screen_zdepth_32_help		Force 32 bit z-buffer. If it works, it will improve the quality in 16 bit colour depth.

screen_check_errors_text	Check Errors:
screen_check_errors_help	Should we listen to the warnings about non-existent video modes during initialisation? Usually, you should leave this option alone.

screen_use_sdl_text		Use SDL OpenGL:
screen_use_sdl_help		Toggles use of the clean OpenGL initialisation routines; if disabled, \g will use the dirty method that was neccesary with SDL 1.0.

screen_grab_mouse_text		Grab Mouse:
screen_grab_mouse_help		If activated, the mouse pointer is centered after every move; thus, it is unable to leave the window. This option is only useful when you play \g in a window.

screen_apply_changes_text	Apply Changes
screen_apply_changes_help	Tries to enable the settings in this menu without exiting \g. Use at your own risk.

screen_keep_window_active_text   Keep Window Active
screen_keep_window_active_help   This toggles if \g should stay active when window mode is selected and \g loses focus.

#detail menu
detail_floor_mirror_text	Floor Mirror:
detail_floor_mirror_help	Which objects should have reflections on the floor?

detail_floor_mirror_off_text	Off
detail_floor_mirror_off_help	None

detail_floor_mirror_obj_text	Objects only
detail_floor_mirror_obj_help	All moving objects

detail_floor_mirror_ow_text	Objects and Walls
detail_floor_mirror_ow_help	Everything that is important in the game

detail_floor_mirror_ev_text	Everything!
detail_floor_mirror_ev_help	(Currently no difference to "Objects and Walls".)

detail_dither_text		Dithering:
detail_dither_help		If the colour depth of your current graphic mode does not directly allow the colour that is to be drawn, it is simulated by mixing other colours. Turning it of will improve software rendering performance on some systems; in low resolution modes, turning it off will even improve the visual quality (IMHO).

detail_floor_text		Floor Detail:
detail_floor_help		Armagetron Advanced has several ways to draw the floor and the grid; the better looking ones will cost you some FPS (Frames Per Second).

detail_floor_no_text		No Floor
detail_floor_no_help		Draw nothing at all. Fastest possibility.

detail_floor_grid_text		Just Grid
detail_floor_grid_help		Only a grid of lines is drawn. This option is your choice if you use software rendering.

detail_floor_tex_text		Textured Plane
detail_floor_tex_help		An infinite plane is drawn, with the texture of the grid painted on it. Recomended for all 3D-card owners. Problem: looking at the horizon, the grid will lose its sharpness too fast.

detail_floor_2tex_text		Dual Texture Plane
detail_floor_2tex_help		Just as in "Textured Plane", the floor is an infinite textured plane. But here, the two groups of lines are drawn in two separate rendering steps, resulting in a much sharper image.

detail_polyantialias_text	Polygon Antial.:
detail_polyantialias_help	Shall the contours of objects be smoothed to avoid ugly pixel stairs? Not implemented on most systems.

detail_lineantialias_text	Line Antialiasing:
detail_lineantialias_help	Should lines be smoothed to avoid pixel stairs?

detail_alpha_text		Alpha Blending:
detail_alpha_help		Alpha blending is used to display half-transparent objects such as explosions and the walls rising behind the cycles. It does not cost extra with most 3D-cards, but slows software rendering down quite a bit.

detail_smooth_text		Smooth Shading:
detail_smooth_help		Makes edges appear "round" by adding a colour gradient to the surfaces. Even software rendering is not slowed down by activating this.

detail_persp_text		Persp. Correction:
detail_persp_help		Most renderers ignore this feature; if really turned off, the wall and floor textures will be displayed horribly deformed. I really don't know why I let you choose this... :)

detail_text_truecolor_text	TrueColour Textures:
detail_text_truecolor_help	Stores the textures with 32 bit colour depth instead of the default of 16 bit.

#preferences menu
pref_sparks_text		Sparks:
pref_sparks_help		Glowing sparks fly from your vehicle whenever you nearly crash.

pref_explosion_text		Explosion:
pref_explosion_help		Toggles the explosion animation when a cycle crashes.

pref_skymove_text		Sky Movement:
pref_skymove_help		Toggles the animation of the lower sky plane.

pref_lowersky_text		Lower Sky:
pref_lowersky_help		Toggles the display of the lower sky plane, a plasma cloud. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_uppersky_text		Upper Sky:
pref_uppersky_help		Toggles the display of the upper sky, a solid plane similar to the floor. Turning both sky planes on hurts performance.

pref_highrim_text		High Rim:
pref_highrim_help		If enabled, the rim walls will have infinite height. If not, they will be about as high as player walls.

pref_headlight_text		Show Headlight:
pref_headlight_help		Render a headlight in front of each cycle.  Requires support by your video card.

pref_showhud_text		Show HUD
pref_showhud_help		If enabled, a heads up display will be shown while playing in single user mode.

pref_showfastest_text		Show Fastest
pref_showfastest_help		Shows the fastest player so far on the grid in a game (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showscore_text 		Show Score
pref_showscore_help		Shows your score and the top score in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showenemies_text		Show Enemies
pref_showenemies_help		Shows how many players are still alive (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showtime_text		Show Time:
pref_showtime_help		Show the current time of day on the HUD.

pref_show24hour_text    Show 24 Hour Clock:
pref_show24hour_help	Shows the clock as a 24 hour clock, if enabled.  Set this to 'off' to show the clock as a 12 hour clock.

pref_showping_text		Show Ping
pref_showping_help		Shows your ping in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showbrake_text		Show Brake Meter
pref_showbrake_help		Shows your brake depletion state in a meter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showspeed_text		Show Speed Meter
pref_showspeed_help		Shows your speed in a metter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

pref_showrubber_text		Show Rubber Meter
pref_showrubber_help		Shows the status of your rubber in a meter in the HUD (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

misc_fps_text			Show FPS:
misc_fps_help			Toggles the display of the current FPS (frames per secon) rate in the upper right corner (Needs Show HUD = On to work).

#tweaks menu
tweaks_displaylists_text	Display Lists:
tweaks_displaylists_help	Display lists are a feature of OpenGL for rendering the same thing many times; it is normally used for the cycles. Some implementations are broken however; if you do no see the cycles, you should disable this feature.

tweaks_ztrick_text		ZTrick:
tweaks_ztrick_help		A speedup that probably only works on old 3dfx cards: instead of clearing the screen after each frame, we just draw the backgroud (floor and rim walls).

tweaks_infinity_text		Infinity:
tweaks_infinity_help		Some planes (grid, sky...) have an infinite extension; if this feature is enabled, they are really drawn as infinite planes. Some OpenGL renderers do not seem to like this (all Windows versions I have seen...); disable it if the floor or sky textures are screwed up.

fullscreen_message_title        Sever Message

network_message_timeout_title	Server does not answer
network_message_timeout_inter	The server you wanted to connect to did not answer for ten seconds.\nIt is probably down or unreachable, or you mistyped its name in the "custom connect" menu.

network_message_dns_error_title	DNS error
network_message_dns_error_inter	The connection name of the server (entered in the Address field) you wanted to connect to does not resolve to an IP address. This either means you mistyped it, that your network is down or that the server no longer is reachable under that name.

network_message_denied_title	Login denied
network_message_denied_inter	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.\nThat usually means it is full.
network_message_denied_inter2	The server you wanted to connect to denied your login attempt.

network_message_lateto_title	Timeout
network_message_lateto_inter	Connection to the server was initially successful; however, synchronising the gamestate failed.\nJust try again!

network_message_lostconn_title	Connection lost
network_message_lostconn_inter	The network connection to the server was lost. This may be due to a real network failure (Ethernet-cable plugged out, modem lost link, ...) or because of a server crash (That would be bad, so please send a bug report if it happens.)

network_message_abortconn_title	Connection terminated
network_message_abortconn_inter	The server terminated our connection.

network_master_timeout_retry	One of the master servers did not answer. Trying next one...\n
network_master_timeout_title	Master server does not answer
network_master_timeout_inter	The master server could not be reached and the server list could not be updated.\nYou'll browse the old list.

network_master_denied_title		Master login denied
network_master_denied_inter		The master server denied your login attempt. That usually means it is full. Try again later.

testing_version_expired_title   Version Expired
testing_version_expired         You are running a public test version or an unsupported CVS build. The server you tried to connect to is running a much newer version and that combination is only supported for major releases.

# title of map error message
map_file_load_failure_title  Map load failure

# printed when a map can't be loaded, and the user can do something about it
map_file_load_failure_self   The map \1 could not be loaded or parsed; please check your configuration and the log below.\n

# printed when a map can't be loaded, and  the failure is the server admin's fault
map_file_load_failure_server  The map \1 could not be loaded.\nThe server you tried to connect to may have a broken configuration; you should inform the server administrator of this error.\n

# worst case: default map could not load, either
map_file_load_failure_default \nFallback to default map did not work either. Please send a bug report, this is unusual.\n

# resource at the wrong place
resource_file_wrong_place_title Incorrect File Path
resource_file_wrong_place     The resource file loaded from "\1" wants to be at "\2". Possible resolutions:\na) If you are not the author of the resource, you should move it to the right place given above and adapt the reference pointing to it.\nb) If you are the author and want the file to stay where it is, you can modify its <Resource> tag so it wants to be where you put it. Consult the documentation on how to do that.\n
