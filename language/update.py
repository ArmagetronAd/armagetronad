# usage: call here to bring all translations up to date
# usage forms:
# update.py [--complete] <list of language files>
#           updates all language files in the editable form (with comments); untranslated items
#           are marked and decorated with the original text and the translations from the other
#           languages from the given file list. Example:
#           update.py spanish.txt is useful for editing the portugese translation if the s
#           panish translation is up to date.
#           the --complete switch adds the original texts as comments to all items, even
#           those already translated.
#
# update.py --dist
#           compactifies translations: strips comments and whitespace
