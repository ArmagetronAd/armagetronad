From Lucifer:  I emailed the author of the math expression library for
permission to use it under the GPL, here is the complete exchange that
gives us permission:

Yann,

I am Dave Fancella with the Armagetron Advanced project, a semi-popular open 
source game, and we've hit a spot where we'd really like to have an 
expression parser.  So I googled up yours, and we'd like to integrate it, but 
I'm concerned about the license.

Armagetron Advanced is available under the GPL, so it has no restrictions on 
commercial use.  I.e. people can sell it.  And we can't add restrictions 
because of the way the GPL is setup.  Would it be possible for us to get a 
slightly more permissive license on your expression parser so that we can use 
it in our game?

Thanks!
Dave

  It is OK tu use my program under a GPL licence. If you need more than my
unofficial approval I can update the files and put them explicitly under
GPL.

  Yours,
