TITLE(First Start)

SUBSECTION([WARNING: (READ IT! it's NOT legalese, I mean it!)])

PARAGRAPH([
Some people react on flashing lights in a very unpleasant manner:
they experience epileptic seizures. Even if you did never have such
a seizure, you may still be affected by those induced seizures. 
Since PROGTITLE contains rhythmic flashing lights (the grid you race
over...), there is a higher risk of induced seizures than in normal
computer games. FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, do NOT play PROGTITLE on a wide TV
screen or in a dark room and always keep a good eye distance to
your monitor. WE DO NOT FEEL RESPONSIBLE for anything that might happen
to you while playing PROGTITLE, even if you do respect these advises
(See legal stuff below). 
])

SUBSECTION(How to play)

PARAGRAPH([
The rules are simple: you ride a lightcycle, a kind of motorbike that
can only turn 90 degrees at a time, leaves a wall behind and cannot be
stopped. Avoid running into a wall while trying to make your opponent run into a wall.
Just in case you do not know: this idea is best known from the Disney
movie "Tron" from 1982. However, that's not the origin of the game idea:
The earliest arcade game of that type was 
ELINK(www.klov.com/B/Blockade.html,Blockade) from 1976, the first known home versions
ELINK(www.thelogbook.com/phosphor/mattel/snafu.html,SNAFU) on the Intellivision from 1981 and
ELINK(www.atarihq.com/reviews/2600/surround.html,Surround) for the Atari 2600.
])

PARAGRAPH([
Acceleration is possible by driving close to player walls, be it your own wall or the
wall of your enemy. Every time you make a turn, you lose a little bit of your speed, so don't be 
too nervous; speed is your only resource against other players!
])

SUBSECTION(Quick start)
PARAGRAPH([
First, you'll be confronted with the selection of your favourite language. 
Use CURSOR LEFT/RIGHT to select, then CURSOR_DOWN to move
to the "Accept" menu item. Then, press ENTER/RETURN three times. 
You'll immediately be set to fight against one weak AI opponent.

SHIFT-ESC is the "boss key" and quits PROGTITLE as fast as possible.
