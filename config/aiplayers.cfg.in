# all values have a range of 0 to 10. More is only meaningful for the range variable.
# the "meta"-meaning of a value was used by me to deduce the AI abilities from the abilites of the real program.
# 1st column "name": Program name
# 2nd column "rs": Program reaction speed (meta: program execution speed)
# 3rd column "er": Reaction in an emergency
# 4th column "vr": Program viewing range
# 5th column "trace": wall tracing ability (meta: how good can the program handle texts?)
# 6th column "close": close combat ability (meta: how good can you control the prog with keyboard alone?)
# 7th column "path": pathfinding ability  (meta: mouse control quality)
# 8th column "loop": ability to detect closed areas and to close the enemy in (meta: is the program secure?)
# 9th column "cycle": ability to evade or cross enemy cycles (meta: is there a feud going on with users of another similar program?)
#10th column "tunl": ability to avoid dangerous tunnels ( meta: is it stable?)
#11th column "tr-det": ability to react on enemy cycles tracing the own wall (meta: meaningful error messages)
#12th column "state": state the AI starts in (0: survive, 1: trace, 2: closecombat, 3: pathfind)
#13th column "str": time the AI drives straight on at the beginning
#14th column "sttch": time before the first state change

# Feel free to modify the AIs or add new ones; but be aware that the interpretation
# of these values is not yet final. PLEASE DON'T send me your changes. They'll
# probably be useless when I get them.
