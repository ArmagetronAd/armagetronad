# visibility culling settings: AA forces the cycle to be visible from the
# camera position, and additionally tracks the visibility of three extra
# points (visibility targets), one in front of the cycle, two by its sides.
# these settings control how they are handled: the front and side distance
# of the targets is determined by _EXTENSION, and the side targets will be
# put forward relative to the cycle by _SIDESKEW. Rays will be cast from the
# cycle to the so determined positions and the real targets will be placed
# at _WALL_DISTANCE times the maximal unblocked distance. Additionally, if the
# targets have been blocked by walls the last frame, they won't snap to the
# full allowed distance right away, but only slowly move there, determined by
# _RECOVERY_SPEED. Lastly, _CLIP_SPEED determines the speed the camera will
# be moved with to keep the extra targets in view.
