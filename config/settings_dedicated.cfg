############################################################################################

# if you are running the server on a machine with no fixed IP address, but have a dynamic DNS 
# address that always resolves to your machine's IP, uncomment the following line and enter the 
# correct dynamic DNS name. This will help the master and the clients to remember your server 
# even after its IP changed.

#Notice: the master server can't handle this currently. I hope to get it
#upgraded for 0.2.8.0. Leave this setting alone for now.
#SERVER_DNS someserver.dyndns.org

# SERVER_IP can be set to the IPs you want the server to listen on. Special
# values are:
#   ANY     opens one socket listening to all IPs ( this was the only available
#           option for 0.2.7.1 and before ). You need one entry of this form if 
#           your server is to appear on the LAN browsers.
#   ALL     opens one socket for each IP. ( equivalent to typing your hostname  )
#   ONEOF   only one socket is opened after this keyword.
#   RELAXED will consider the initialization as successful if at least one 
#           socket was opened. 
# IGNOREERRORS will continue despite fatal errors like DNS lookup failures and
#           attempts to bind to IPs not owned by the local machine.

# You can also specify a hostname instead of an IP. In that case, every IP that 
# the hostname is known under will get its own socket. 
# You can modify the port to listen on by adding an offset to the current port after a colon.
# If you bind your server to multiple IPs, only one of them ( the first from which the connection 
# to the master server succeeds ) will be made public by the master server. 

# If your settings of SERVER_IP fails to initialize, "ANY" is tried insead, if that fails, 
# "ALL" is tried.

# examples:

# default: bind to one generic socket on one port.
SERVER_IP ANY

# bind to all available sockets on the default port
#SERVER_IP ALL

# only bind to the loopback interface on the default port (this
# server will only be visible on your own machine)
#SERVER_IP 127.0.0.1

# bind to all local IPs with one socket each ( for the internet traffic )
# and open another socket listening to no specific IP on the next port 
# ( to catch LAN server browser broadcasts ). Relies on a thoroughly
# configured hosts file that maps your hostname to all IPs your computer
# has.
# SERVER_IP ALL ANY:1

# the settings for my CVS test servers. armagetron.kicks-ass.net will resolve to the
# current dynamic IP of my server. Additionally, a broadcast listening socket is created.
# use this (adapted to your IP, of course), maybe without the ANY:1 part, 
# if you want your own sever to appear on your internet server list.
#SERVER_IP armagetron.kicks-ass.net ANY:1

# hypothetical server setup: bind to the first of the listed IPs availablbe.
# This is for running multiple servers with the same config that should bind to
# different IPs instead of to differnt ports.
#SERVER_IP ONEOF ip1 ip2 ip2 ip3 ip4 ...

# same as above, but open three servers per IP before going to the next.
#SERVER_IP ONEOF ip1:0 ip1:1 ip1:2 ip2:0 ip2:1 ip2:2 ....

############################################################################################

# Debugging a game on a dedicated server can be tricky since you don't have a
# representation of the world handy in visual form. Therefore, the game offers
# to log all cycle movements in text files for easy processing in a display
# tool ( plain gnuplot is often enough ). The files' names are the player
# name with appended _sync for the network sync turn positions, _step for
# dumps of every timestep and _turn for all turns. All topology police a
# posteriory wall collision events are logged in _topology.
# Activate this crude debugging help by uncommenting the following line:
