# How wingmen are placed in formation. At SPEED_FACTOR 0, the unit 
# is meters, and the values are scaled up with speed.

# These settings determine who gets the score for a kill. Generally, the player that
# has the most recent influence on the victim gets the credit (or the blame if it's a teammate).
# An influence currently is a close encounter with a wall, the time of the influence is
# the time the wall was built.
# The effective time entering the comparison is modified by these settings:

ENEMY_TEAMMATE_PENALTY 2500.0   # Penalty on the effective time in seconds if the influence is from a teammate
# ENEMY_SELF_PENALTY 3000.0     # Penalty on the effective time in seconds if the influence is from the victim itself (removed, does not make sense)
ENEMY_DEAD_PENALTY 0.0          # Penalty on the effective time in seconds if the influence comes from a dead player
ENEMY_CHATBOT_PENALTY 30.0      # Penalty in seconds if the victim is in chatbot state and the influence is just the chatbot evading a wall
ENEMY_CURRENTTIME_INFLUENCE 0.0 # If set to 1, not the build time of the encountered wall, but the current time enters the comparison. Arbitrary blending values are allowed.
ENEMY_SUICIDE_TIMEOUT 10000.0   # If no enemy influence can be found for the last this many seconds, the death counts as a suicide.

FORTRESS_CONQUEST_RATE .5        # the number of enemies inside the fortress zone is counted, multiplied with this value and added to the "conquered" variable. Increase this to make conquering easier.
FORTRESS_DEFEND_RATE .25         # the number of owners inside the fortress zone is counted, multiplied with this value and subtracted from the "conquered" variable. Increase to make defending easier.
FORTRESS_CONQUEST_DECAY_RATE .1  # this value is subtracted. Increase to make defending easier.
FORTRESS_CONQUEST_TIMEOUT 0      # timeouts for enemy contacts with the zone. If a zone would collapse without a defender (as on Sumo), the zone will collapse harmlessly after all enemy contatcs timed out.

# what happens when a zone gets conquered

FORTRESS_CONQUERED_SCORE 0        # the conquering party gets this many points (divided among the conquerors)
FORTRESS_CONQUERED_WIN 0          # if set to 1, the conquering party wins the round
FORTRESS_CONQUERED_KILL_MIN 0     # the closest X players of the owning team get killed at least
FORTRESS_CONQUERED_KILL_RATIO 0.0 # this fraction of the players of the owning team get killed

FORTRESS_SURVIVE_WIN 1            # if set to 1, the last team with an unconquered zone wins the round
FORTRESS_MAX_PER_TEAM 0           # if > 0, this is the maximal number of fortress zones ownable by a team. Closer zones are prefered. Use this to prune noninhabited zones in multi-team maps.

SPAWN_POINT_GROUP_SIZE 0          # if > 2, this is interpreted as the number of spawn points in a spawn point group. AA then tries not to spawn one player alone in one spawn point group by redistributing them slightly.

# Armagetron Advanced is fully compatible with old clients down to 0.2.0 
# with the default settings. This changes if you alter some settings from 
# the default: the most glaring example would be changing the map to
# play on. The following settings determine what happens when an old
# client connects and some settings the client does not yet understand
# are not on their defaults. Set the configuration items to 2 to simply
# block the client, set it to 1 to allow the client in and revert the
# relevant settings to their default (this may be confusing to users
# of a newer client, they'll experience the change and have to adapt), 
# or 0 to just leave the settings as they are, but allow the client in 
# anyway. Choose 0 or 2 to be nice to new clients, 1 to be nice to old
# clients.
#

SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_BREAKING     2  # For settings that absolutely break the client and make play impossilbe. Example of an affected setting: MAP_FILE
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_BUMPY        2  # For settings that allow play on old clients in principle, but with severe limitations (cycles bouncing around, player commands not executed on time). Example: CYCLE_DELAY_TIMEBASED
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_ANNOYING     0  # For settings that only cause minor annoyances on old clients, like enemy cycles stopping for .1 seconds after each turn. Example: CYCLE_RUBBER_MINDISTANCE
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_CHEATING     2  # For settings where the default behavior could be considered cheating if nondefault was set. Example: DOUBLEBIND_TIME
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_VISUAL       0  # For settings that only affect status displays and visuals, not game physics. Example: CYCLE_RUBBER_* (the client displays the rubber meter, but it's not used for anything)

#
# Instead of selecting the behavior per group, you can override the 
# behavior of the affected configuraton one by one: to change it
# for a variable named FOO, set FOO_OVERRIDE to 1 to revert FOO to
# its default when an old client connects, or 0 to let the old client
# in and leave FOO as it was. The default is always 3, which means
# to use the setting of the class corresponding to FOO. For map
# settings, this means concretely:
#

# uncomment the following line if you want to revert to the default map as soon as a client that
# does not yet support maps connects.
#MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE   1

# uncomment this line if you want to use a nondefault map even if old clients are online
# (useful for example if your map only differs from the default map in the spawnpoints)
#MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE   0

# default override setting: let the setting class decide. In the case of maps, the class
# is BREAKS (old clients can't cope at all with nondefault settings), so old clients
# are not allowed to connect if MAP_FILE differs from the default.
MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE    3

# visibility culling settings: AA forces the cycle to be visible from the
# camera position, and additionally tracks the visibility of three extra
# points (visibility targets), one in front of the cycle, two by its sides.
# these settings control how they are handled: the front and side distance
# of the targets is determined by _EXTENSION, and the side targets will be
# put forward relative to the cycle by _SIDESKEW. Rays will be cast from the
# cycle to the so determined positions and the real targets will be placed
# at _WALL_DISTANCE times the maximal unblocked distance. Additionally, if the
# targets have been blocked by walls the last frame, they won't snap to the
# full allowed distance right away, but only slowly move there, determined by
# _RECOVERY_SPEED. Lastly, _CLIP_SPEED determines the speed the camera will
# be moved with to keep the extra targets in view.
