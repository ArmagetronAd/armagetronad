# Armagetron Advanced is fully compatible with old clients down to 0.2.0 
# with the default settings. This changes if you alter some settings from 
# the default: the most glaring example would be changing the map to
# play on. The following settings determine what happens when an old
# client connects and some settings the client does not yet understand
# are not on their defaults. Set the configuration items to 2 to simply
# block the client, set it to 1 to allow the client in and revert the
# relevant settings to their default (this may be confusing to users
# of a newer client, they'll experience the change and have to adapt), 
# or 0 to just leave the settings as they are, but allow the client in 
# anyway. Choose 0 or 2 to be nice to new clients, 1 to be nice to old
# clients.
#

SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_BREAKING     2  # For settings that absolutely break the client and make play impossilbe. Example of an affected setting: MAP_FILE
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_BUMPY        2  # For settings that allow play on old clients in principle, but with severe limitations (cycles bouncing around, player commands not executed on time). Example: CYCLE_DELAY_TIMEBASED
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_ANNOYING     0  # For settings that only cause minor annoyances on old clients, like enemy cycles stopping for .1 seconds after each turn. Example: CYCLE_RUBBER_MINDISTANCE
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_CHEATING     2  # For settings where the default behavior could be considered cheating if nondefault was set. Example: DOUBLEBIND_TIME
SETTING_LEGACY_BEHAVIOR_VISUAL       0  # For settings that only affect status displays and visuals, not game physics. Example: CYCLE_RUBBER_* (the client displays the rubber meter, but it's not used for anything)

#
# Instead of selecting the behavior per group, you can override the 
# behavior of the affected configuraton one by one: to change it
# for a variable named FOO, set FOO_OVERRIDE to 1 to revert FOO to
# its default when an old client connects, or 0 to let the old client
# in and leave FOO as it was. The default is always 3, which means
# to use the setting of the class corresponding to FOO. For map
# settings, this means concretely:
#

# uncomment the following line if you want to revert to the default map as soon as a client that
# does not yet support maps connects.
#MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE   1

# uncomment this line if you want to use a nondefault map even if old clients are online
# (useful for example if your map only differs from the default map in the spawnpoints)
#MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE   0

# default override setting: let the setting class decide. In the case of maps, the class
# is BREAKS (old clients can't cope at all with nondefault settings), so old clients
# are not allowed to connect if MAP_FILE differs from the default.
MAP_FILE_OVERRIDE    3

# Slicing and dicing time
# Sometimes, due to real world glitches, large timesteps need to be simulated.
# Simulating them all at once is a recipe for disaster, so we slice the
# big timestep into many small ones. Care needs to be taken, if the
# small steps are too small, a weak server may not be able to keep up with
# the action. When the two settings contradict each other in a given situation,
# TIMESTEP_MAX_COUNT takes precedence.

TIMESTEP_MAX .2       # the maximal size of the small timesteps
TIMESTEP_MAX_COUNT 10 # the maximal number of small timesteps to divide a large timestep in

# if something interesting is going to happen to a game object not more
# than MAX_SIMULATE_AHEAD seconds from the time it should be simulated to,
# simulate it up to the interesting bit, not only the scheduled time.
MAX_SIMULATE_AHEAD .01

# If the cycle simulation code on the server thinks that a client cycle control command is missing
# due to packet loss (and a later command has already arrived), it will wait for this long
# times the ping for the missed packet to arrive.
CYCLE_PACKETMISS_TOLERANCE 3

# fudge factor when executing client turn commands on the server. If a turn should have
# happened in the current timestep, but can't really because something came in between,
# simulate this many seconds additionally to get to the point where the turn can be exectuted.
CYCLE_DEST_SIMULATE_AHEAD .01

# Game level lag compensation

# The network code level only is capable of predicting and compensating stable latency times.
# It can't properly react on variances in the ping and the occasional packet loss burst.
# That's where the game level lag compensation kicks in. First, let's handle the server
# side:

# The server allocates each client a certain time amount of extra lag credit. If a
# command message arrives late and the credit is not used up, the simulation of the
# game object in question can be rolled back to the time of the command, and the
# amount of time that is rolled back is subtracted from the lag credit. This
# variable determines the total amount of lag credit maximally available,
# measured in seconds. Setting this to a finite value allows for some cheating by
# manipulated clients, so don't increase it too much. The default value does not
# allow cheaters to create too much damage.
LAG_CREDIT .5

# Lag credit is not something that is available once. Just like rubber, lag credit
# is refilled over time. This variable tells you how long it takes before a completely
# used up lag credit takes to completely refill. 
LAG_CREDIT_TIME 600

# The server sends messages to the client, informing it about lag compensation that used
# up lag credit. The client tries to avoid using up too much credit by manipulating the game
# timer, more on that later. This is the server determined fill ratio of the lag credit
# that the client tries to maintain. You shouldn't need to touch this.
LAG_SWEET_SPOT .5

# Now, to the clientside settings. As mentioned, the client receives information from the
# server whenever a game object control message was measureably delayed and compensation
# was required. In order to avoid those events in the future, the client manipulates the
# game timer; it makes it go slighly faster for a while so game object control commands
# get sent with a later timestamp and don't have to be backdated before they can be executed
# accurately. Two counters keep track of the lag reports, one slow one for compentsating
# long term fluctuations in the link quality, and a fast one for compensating lag spikes.

# This variable controls how much relative speedup the game timer maximally can get
# during compensation:
LAG_MAX_SPEEDUP_TIMER .2

# These two variables control how fast the lag mearures go back to reporting "Situation
# normalized, no measurable lag". The variables give the time for that in seconds.
LAG_SLOW_TIME 120.0
LAG_FAST_TIME 5.0

# These two variables determine the impact of lag reports from the server on the two
# measurers. The impact is full on the fast measurer and lower on the slow measurer,
# because the slow measurer takes longer to recover and shouldn't react in panic.
LAG_SLOW_WEIGHT 0.1
LAG_FAST_WEIGHT 1.0

# On top of the measured lag, the timer goes faster by this amount in seconds even
# if no lag was reported. Increase this if you know you have a very bad network link
# and if you are experiencing lag slides on servers running 0.2.8.3 or later.
LAG_OFFSET_CLIENT 0.0

# This setting has exactly the same effect, but is server controlled. Use it if your
# server is on a crappy connection.
LAG_OFFSET_SERVER 0.0


# deprecated settings, they'll go away unless there are protests

CYCLE_RUBBER_MALUS_TURN 0                       # rubber usage gets increased by this amout after each turn...
